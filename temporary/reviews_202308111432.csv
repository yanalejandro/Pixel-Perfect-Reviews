4,"2018-06-14",126,1086,676,0,1,Out of all the reviews I wrote This one is probably the most serious one I wrote. For starters the community of this game sucks just like every online game You don't wanna talk to them because they're all just jerks who wanna say you suck or you camped or blah blah blah its rare to get a nice compliment out of people in this game.But you don't have to talk to the community either. Unlike most online games this one doesn't have a mic system so you don't have to worry about hearing a twelve year old cry baby raging at you for nothing. Only time you can talk to people in the game is in the beginning before the match starts if your a survivor and at the end after the match is over as both killer and survivor The end chat is the only one the killer can talk to everyone in the match though. Mostly just to say GG for Good Game.As Survivor you can basically just play every man for himself and be sneaky and say screw you to the other players or you can try to be a good team mate and rescue them if they get on a hook but if someone is a jerk in the chat before the match then you know who not to save if they get hooked. I mostly play killer because I find it more fun than playing survivor and someones gotta play killer and from what I hear most people enjoy playing survivor more. Probably becuase as survivor it feels like a horror game and you get team mates while as killer you're by yourself.But what i'm really trying to say is this game is really great even though the community sucks Just ignore the community and if you get someone who is raging at the end just say gg to them and leave. After seeing that they didn't make you argue with them and waste your time it might make them even more mad even if you got the last word aka GG. So I give this game a 8/10. I wonder if anyone actually read this review I actually had to take my time to write this because I didn't wanna swear in it so you didn't see nothing but censor hearts that steam likes to do. So if you actually read this let me know by leaving a comment so I can be like someone read this peice of crap review yay!,Dead by Daylight,1,
5,"2017-06-20",85,2139,612,0,1,Disclaimer I survivor main. I play games for fun not for competition so the DBD community doesn't really get to me. If I get a bad killer that face camps oh well. I die and move on to the next game. If I get a good killer who finds me immediately hooks me (bc I can't juke whoops) and then patrol camps (which I'm 100% OK with) then no biggie. Next game please I think a lot of the community salt from killers comes from dealing with rank one survivors that don't actually play the game properly and just run around and flash the killer in the face. And while that is a legitimate strategy it takes away from the fun of the game in my opinion.As a killer (a horrible one) I've also been called names by survivors who tell me to 'get gud.' Older players ruin it for newer players or players who don't put in 1000s of hours. Just relax and have fun with the game! So what if you don't pip up there is always the next game )That being said this game is crazy fun. Don't let the saltiness of the community keep you from buying the game. Grab it have fun with it and ignore anyone who might give you a hard time ) And don't fixate too much on the ranking process unless you're absurdly highly competitive for some reason (also fine just try not to let it push you into spouts of anger!) and even then recognize that there are jerks who play this game like any other game and have fun while you compete!,Dead by Daylight,1,
6,"2016-12-12",4,55,2694,0,1,"ENGLISH After playing for more than two years I am given the task of reviewing this game again.This review will be as complete as possible so if you do not want to see the full review I recommend you go to the final part of the review to see the opinion and final rating. This review will consist of 5 sections and some sub sections.GameplayThis game consists of there being 4 survivor and one killer who must complete a series of objectives on a map. Survivors must escape from the killer by repairing 5 generators and opening doors. For its part the killers must pursue hang sacrifice or kill the survivors.Survivors and killers have the possibility to use perks objects accessories and offerings that help to give advantage within a game.Offers good mechanics for escaping the killer or catching the survivor as Pallets Windows 360's Moonwalks Hide Different powers in each killerThe balancing is one of the most difficult aspects of the game. Each update changes the balance making nerf or buff to the killer and survivors. In my opinion there are many things where the balancing is good. but there are many other things that fail a lot.Rating Balance 6/10 Mechanical system 9/10 Innovation 8/10 Gameplay 8/10Graphics It uses the graphic engine Unreal Engine 4 which is an engine with quite good lighting and easy to use with respect to other engines. In the graphic section optimization and animation Dead by Daylight is mediocre because there are enough graphic bugs or animation but it must be understood that Behaviour is not Epic game to be able to invest so much money in that aspect. Animation 6/10 Optimization 5/10 Graphics 6/10 Matchmaking In this aspect the game has improved a lot these 2 years but it's still quite mediocre there are quite a few bugs in looking for killers and supervients. The worst thing is that the host is the killer and there are no servers. And besides the rank system fails a lot there are games that can touch you ranks 20 being rank 1. Servers 0/10 Matchmaking 5/10 Conclusion This game has great potential for anyone who likes the ""Slasher"" or wants to spend good nights with friends or killing survivors. That potential is covered up by big bugs.

9,"2018-09-21",2,54,400,0,1,Any longtime Dead by Daylight player knows that this isn't a horror game. If you're looking for scares I wouldn't consider this to be a scary game because it becomes quite predictable over time. It doesn't have enough build up of suspense to instill fear of actually getting caught by the killer. That said and set aside I enjoy a good chase or simply losing the killer's line of sight and giving them the slip. It can be quite funny when you outsmart someone by hiding around a tree or a rock. There have been times where I have lost killers simply by doing circles around an object and remaining hidden. Those moments are where the game succeeds in my eyes. Hide and seek has always been fun for me in games that can manage to get it right and it's one of the aspects that drew me to Dead by Daylight. It's a game about being sneaky and trying not to get caught. On the other hand however getting seen on purpose and taking the killer for a long chase helps your team repair generators unhindered and also gains you plenty of boldness points for distracting and ultimately helping your team escape as a whole because every second a killer spends wasted on chasing a pro runner is a second your 3 teammates need to utilize towards getting the 5 generators in the map up and running to power the exit door. Contentwise there is a continued introduction of new killers and survivors alongside them each with their own unique abilities which keeps things interesting. As with any game I feel the need to mention that a community and the people encountered in online situations are what make and break a game and sometimes it's possible that you get a killer that camps you after he has hung you up on the hook which can be very not fun. I give Dead by Daylight an 8/10 and I've enjoyed my many hours playing and so I will recommend.,Dead by Daylight,1,

11,"2018-12-04",11,106,900,0,1,"This is simultaneously the most fun and most infuriating game I've played in a long time.It's an asymmetrical game where one player is a powerful killer hunting down 4 elusive survivors before they can start generators and leave the trial.For an asymmetrical game it's in a state where it's surprisingly balanced between the two sides. Either side has a few things that infuriate the other (Decisive Strike and No One Escapes Death are the current front runners) and certain killers are notoriously overpowered or underpowered. Freddy Kreuger mains for instance must hate themselves to play that and Nurse mains must just hate playing the game fairly.New content is regular 1 killer 1 survivor 3 perks for each side and a map are released every 3 months or so mid chapter balance patches occur and cosmetics are regularly added.There are downsides however. While balance patches come regularly they won't do anything incremental. Freddy is ridiculously weak but they refuse to give him small quality of life changes that they have said he needs until they are ready to release a full rework of him. Meaning rather than sitting at a 'meh' stage he sits in boring weak and generally unfun.Pay to pay to keep paying. Buying the game will net you around half the cast. Many are also available through grinding however licensed killers and survivors require further payment. Their perks are also locked to you unless they are picked on the ""random"" weekly shrine. (The good ones rarely are.) On top of this despite in game currency being used for cosmetics anything they think looks good or will be popular is locked behind payment only. It's a move when you may have already spent upwards of $80 just to unlock characters.Awesome and incredibly angry community as you'd expect from a game like this.",Dead by Daylight,1,

Where killing requires significantly more concentration survivor is somewhat more chill as an experienced player but is often an M1 simulator if you dont involve yourself with the game much. This repetivity is very clear but the different survivors you play against all have different playstyles and the killers have completely different ""powers"" which can tilt the game at any point. If you want a more relaxing experience to sit down and play something then it would be better to play survivor. Killer requires endless concentration and intense focus so you need to be in a proper gaming mood.I would highly recommend this game to someone who needs a time waster video game and wants to funnel some hours into it in their spare time. It's a good horror for the first 50 hours but loses that factor after you stop taking the game seriously in terms of getting scared. There is a grinding system involved which will take anyone a long time to get anything especially the bare bone amount you earn ingame but achieving the grind and getting the perks (massive game factor) that you want that will greatly change the way you play. It's just amazing and the game I turn on everyday for a good 6+ hours.",Dead by Daylight,1,

Pros +Cool horror environment+Plenty of unique killers to choose from each with a different power to help them hunt and kill their prey+The asymmetrical teams are so different that it effectively provides two games for the price of one+Pretty cheap for a full game that isn't even that old+Provides endless challenge due to skill based matches and a ranked system+Can play with friends or make new friends or KILL YOUR FRIENDSCons Some annoying bugs especially after a patch Moronic community but this is somewhat remedied by lack of in game chatOverall I have to say if you think this game looks cool GET IT. I had a blast when I first learned the game and I stuck with it to master the challenges and achieve rank 1. I still to this day love all the characters and environments and continue to get refreshing little spooks from certain characters (The Shape The Hag). I am always excited when a new character comes out because they are all so cool and add something interesting to the game. Even when Leatherface was released the second chainsaw wielding maniac of the game he turned out to be very different than his counterpart The Hillbilly. As a killer main my primary frustrations come from survivors being the little bastards that they are but this is alleviated when I brutally murder them and watch them die on a meat hook. Get this game if you want to kill people! shodan,Dead by Daylight,1,

No doubt about it.However... the devs hate their playerbase and have literally told us if we don't like it to go play another game.The community themselves is also fairly toxic when it comes to interacting with eachother. Every comment has come from somebody that got salty and made a dramatic situation out of nothing.Ultimately I would not advise buying this game due to the nature of the toxicity and how salty it can make you. Even I get super salty and say I don't mean sometimes and it's only this game that does it.,Dead by Daylight,1,
34,"2019-01-27",0,0,73,0,1,Dead by Daylight is a game with a lot of potential. Even after years of being out it still continues to provide fun gameplay and hours of entertainment. However this game has many problems that need fixing. As the survivor you may find that there are a million hooks in the map and that there is really no point in wiggling unless you are in a SWF (Survive With Friends) and know that they will help (bodyblocking sabotaging etc.). Also the biggest problem that MANY people complain about is the P2P server system. If you don't know what P2P is it means the killer is the server. If the killers internet randomly spikes to 300 ping it will only affect you and can get you killed. As of writing this review Dead by Daylight is planning on implementing dedicated servers to fix this problem. Many people also complain about the hitboxes being too big and can sometimes result in getting hit through windows/pallets.Now that the bad stuff is out of the way we can get to the good stuff. I am sure you are tired with a bunch of text so ill put it in a list form. Lets you buy DLC with earnable ingame currency. Many killers and survivors with a variety of perks. One of the first and few of its kind. Still a decent size player base after years. Has a skill gap even with being a casual game.Overall I would give it a 6.3847293940182/9.9999734846.,Dead by Daylight,1,

53,"2018-03-04",0,0,349,0,1,DbD is one of my all time favorites. A simple concept but executed beautifully by the devs with the setting lore etc. Admittedly this game can be very frustrating at times (bugs cheaters hackers unbalanced etc). Recently I was dismayed by the shear number of dc'ers as it is literally more often than not that someone disconnects from the game when disadvantaged regardless of whether I play as the killer or survivor. I have submitted multiple complaints and felt as though my plea for harsher punishments wasn't being heard. However based on some of the recent reviews in which some have complained about being banned for disconnecting (most of them do in fact display unsportsmanlike behavior by disconnecting don't listen to their lies and sad excuses) I am confident that the devs are listening. The fact that this online game is almost 3 years old with regular updates speaks volumes. Please keep up the good work and I hope you continue to show your love for this game devs. If you do I will always remain an ardent supporter. Thank you for your work!,Dead by Daylight,1,

They also released a killer called ""The Legion"" Which i suggest you don't buy because he is one of if not the WORST killer in the game (trust me kids i played him till he was lvl 40.)

The game was on sale so I bought it along with the Halloween chapter. Holy hell the first night I played (in the dark of course) my whole body got stiff when I would hear the music indicating that the killer was nearby.

68,"2019-01-29",0,0,78,0,1,Dead By Daylight is the best survivor horror game and i liked it so much. At the start it was a bit scary but later on its very fun to play. There are varieties of killers survivors and maps in this game. The graphics sound effects are awesome and there are various events once in couple of months and that events are also nicely created and fun to play. The developers of this game fixes issues crashes bugs etc with monthly update patch. So i will definately recommend dead by daylight to all those gamers who likes to survival horror game believe me once you started playing dead by daylight you will become addicted to it.,Dead by Daylight,1,
69,"2019-01-29",0,0,74,0,1,Dead by daylight is a fun game plain and simple. There are many things that need to be tweaked (bugs balancing too quick games etc) but there is nothing about this game that dampers the fun too much. What I love about the game is the distinct differece between playing as the killer and the survivor. I mainly play the killer because I've yet to convince my friends that this is a good game but being killer is such a good time. It really forces you to get inside the head of your victims and make quick and smart decisions. Every choice you make can make or break a match. Should you go after the injured one or the one working on a generator? Will this person throw this pallet down? Which gate are they going to? Every choice you make really can change a game which is why it's so fun. You rarely find two games that are alike. Similar sure but never alike. This creates hours of fun not to mention all of the different killers there are to choose from whcih change the game even more. Playing survivor can also be fun but you almost always need to be a team player. Rarely will you win if you go on your own and you don't help your team. This creates much tension and stress when you play because your team is relying on you just as much as you are relying on them. This also makes winning all the more satisfying. There are also constant updates adding new and fresh content which is a plus. Community wise toxicity can be an issue depending on who you play with but it isn't that bad. If you play fair enough you shouldn't have a problem. I highly reccommend this game to those with friends and to solo players alike you are bound to find enjoyment out of it. It may take a bit to ease into but I really do think that this is a good game.,Dead by Daylight,1,
70,"2018-02-20",0,0,211,0,0,It starts off well then you slowly see how bad the game gets.the devs dont care about the game's huge problem... the killer is weak and the survivors op causing many killers to play survivor and thus noobie killers thinking they will have fun are paired up with strong survivors. a chase with a survivor can last 2 5 min (not counting perks that can give the survivor a second chance like death strike and dead hard) and generator can be finished in 3 min (not counting great skill cheks and toolboxes).the game is in ruin unless the devs wake up and fix the survivors and fix the killers that are simply not viable to play as it very well should die.,Dead by Daylight,1,
71,"2019-01-29",0,0,157,0,1,"TL DR Pretty good game overall but bring a salt shaker.The game is fleshed out to most degree involving what it wants to do with itself. It has a simple goal and does its job well. Where things get complicated is it's balancing. It has a horendious amount of skills ranging from powerful and meta grade to completely pointless. Combinations of which turn even the worst player into a god among men regarding killers.The killers are some of the best fun you will have and mostly due to the fact that after dying to them 100 times the occasional play of them makes you feel the rush of having killed those other players that screwed up the generator 50 times in one go. Playing the survivors is like hoping the other 3 players are not braindead lunatics or those special ""Meta Monsters"" who want to farm bloodpoints by breaking generators to fix them and being chased for the entire game just to ditch the monster on you so you can die in their place. I won't even try to talk about the toxicity of the community....",Dead by Daylight,1,

73,"2019-01-29",0,0,44,0,1,SURVIVOR REVIEW As a person who hates to be abused by unfair AI while playing a horror game. This game is perfect for me to be honest playing survivor is fun it also gets repetitive if you have a good squad and they is only a couple broken survivors (im looking at you Claudette). And the survivor mode is alright with friends you will have a hearty laugh for the first hour but after that you will start taking the game so less seriously when you learn how to counter the killers whether it be by insidious looping around pallets or whether it just be making the killer chase you for about seven minuets because the killer's are so slow and you use a system to unlock perks called the bloodweb which is randomly generated every level which means you and your friend can be playing the same survivor but you will both be getting different perks which is beneficial and also you will get offerings which most of the time give you extra bloodpoints which is cool but they also give add ons and items and at increments of 5 levels you will be unlocking perk slots to allow greater survivability. But the reason survivors are fun is how unique every survivor is some specialize in healing others specialize in risky gameplay its about the style you wanna play.KILLER REVIEW Remember what i said about unfair AI? Well in this game you can play as a killer and murder everyone while almost being unstoppable (Pallets and looping aside). The killer aspect of the game is the best part of the game in my humble opinion finding survivors and killing them is so damn fun watching them try to find a pallet to stop you and then hitting them just before they can press the action button is hilarious and then watching as their friends attempt to save their friends in the basement which has dire consequences upon any survivor using the basement. My favorite killer in the game currently is The Legion not because they are broken Or not because of their backstory (The backstory is nice). But i like them because its not a cliche killer they are an average sized human and not possesed or covered in mud or throws hatchets because they have an uncanny need to snipe people. No The Legion is just a group of 19 year olds who preforms acts of violence and honestly i love this they are so fun to play and their perks are crazy.Buy The Game when it goes on sale.Play with friends if you like them.KILL OR BE KILLED.Its a good game overall no matter if you like to play survivors or killer.,Dead by Daylight,1,

83,"2019-02-01",8,389,501,0,1,Product received for free. To be completely forward and honest I may be biased because I was a beta tester for Wargroove and I am a big fan of games like Advance Wars and Battle for Wesnoth. However this is my honest opinion on the game.This is the game I ve been waiting for and has exceeded my expectations. Now at first glance this game looks very similar to Advance Wars and you d be right. However this is much more than just an Advance Wars clone and greatly improves the Advance Wars formula and adds its own elements to it making it much less of a slow paced meatgrinder and much more aggressive and focused on good positioning. Games go by quickly and are very skill based with minimal luck.Let s start with one of the strongest points of the game the core gameplay. In a standard match of Wargroove you start with a Commander a Stronghold a Soldier or two and a few other structures. The objective of the game is to defeat your opponent s Commander or their Stronghold. If either of them fall the player loses. However there is a sub objective. Across the map are structures that can be captured. Villages provide income barracks let you produce land units towers let you produce air units and ports let you produce sea units. All units have 100 health but they deal different damage to different units in a sort of rock paper scissors fashion. Each unit has a unique way of dealing bonus damage called a Critical Hit. There is no luck involved in critical hits. Critical hits occur when certain criteria are met. For example Archers are a ranged unit that can move and attack at the same time. However they deal 35% more damage if they stand still and attack giving you the choice of moving or staying in place for a big boost in damage. The strongest unit in your arsenal by far is your Commander however. They re comparable to the strongest ground unit in terms of durability and damage except they heal per turn and can charge up an ability called a Groove which can range from summoning a skeleton warrior to dashing through an entire army dealing massive damage. While it is important to keep your Commander alive you need to use them because they are such a valuable asset in your army. The only difference between Commanders are their Grooves and the only difference between the factions are how the units visually look. It s very balanced and various playstyles are viable in multiplayer.Now fans of Advance Wars may be wary of naval units but sea is actually useful and healthy for the gameplay. I would argue that the most fun maps are ones that seamlessly combine ground air and sea together because they work so well together and gives you so many options. The reason why sea units aren t worthless or annoying like they are in Advance Wars is because all of the sea units can interact with the ground and air units except for Turtles which are the kings of the sea but are countered by Harpoon Ships which also act as anti air. There are Amphibian infantry units who can capture villages out at sea or on land and all of the units are relatively cheap for their power. For context the strongest sea unit is 900 gold while the strongest air unit is 1250 gold and the strongest ground unit is 1200.Now on top of this solid foundation there are a myriad of singleplayer and multiplayer modes. For singleplayer here s the 30+ mission campaign that will last you many hours oldschool style unlocks an arcade mode similar to fighting games and a puzzle mode. For local multiplayer there are skirmishes where you can either play against the AI or play with someone else on the same machine as you. For online multiplayer there s quick play where you get automatically matched up with a random player and play on a random map with a time limit. If you want a slower paced game want to play with a friend or you want to have a specific map or rule set then you can host a lobby and invite people via a code system.On top of these game modes there s also extremely powerful map and campaign creation tools. The developers used the campaign and map editor to create the official campaign themselves. It lets you create large maps small maps and lets you place structures units terrain and even allows you to script your own scenarios or puzzles. It s comparable to Starcraft s editor and can allow for some really interesting custom rules and maps. You can play these maps online with other players as well which is very exciting for everyone and gives the game practically infinite replayability.While I am not a big fan of the campaign the puzzle mode was fun for a quick dose of Wargroove and the arcade can be a fun challenge. However I ve spent many hours creating my own maps and scenarios and playing online with other people is extremely fun and I hope that a competitive scene grows because I would love to watch and participate in it.For options and other quality of life features you can have animations only play during certain situations or even flat out remove the animations. Holding down right click speeds up unit movement and you can cut animations short by holding down right click if you like to have animations only occasionally or if you like to have animations play for a very short time. You can turn on the grid and you have various audio sliders with an option for using headphone and speakers. If you choose speakers it makes the stereo audio a lot more dramatic while headphones it s more subtle. The game can be played with gamepad or mouse and keyboard but sadly you cannot change the keybinds. There are also various colorblind modes that change the army colors to make it easier to see and there is an option to have your gamepad vibrate when it s your turn if you re using a gamepad.I recommend this game for anyone who is even remotely interested and I d definitely recommend anyone who is a fan of Advance Wars or any other turn based strategy games. The sheer amount of content alone is enough to justify the price and the gameplay is so well executed it would be difficult to ever go back to Advance Wars. This game is a masterpiece.,Wargroove,1,

86,"2019-02-05",3,53,7,0,1,Games like this make me wish there was a Neutral rating. It has the elements of a great tactics based game but there are very serious pitfalls for it as well. The lack of unit diversity. The game touts having 4 factions but each of them have all the same units just with different sprites so there's no real tactical choice between any of them besides which sprites you like the most and which commander you want to play. Each commander's unique Grooves. These have wildly variable usefulness ranging from putting up a protective barrier in a wide area healing all nearby allied units to occasionally summoning a single version of the lowest tier unit or moving a single generic enemy unit somewhere else in a very wide area on the map. They are all touted as being able to change your tactics completely but because they can only be used every few turns at most they're little more than an occasional bonus if even that. Commanders themselves fall under the same problem as the first point in that they're all generic units with no variance in stats or combat style. This is particularly jarring when you're dealing with commanders who wield magic but can only attack at close range. You have commanders who are obviously mages or soldiers or literally a dog but they all behave like generic Commander units. The fog of war. It's immensely unfair that the fog of war only applies to you. You send a unit or two out forward to scout and suddenly they're surrounded by enemies they couldn't have possibly noticed but who all know where all of your units are at any point in time.It is a VERY GOOD tactics game in the vein of the old Advance Wars games. I personally lean more towards Fire Emblem but I enjoy all tactics games and this with the notable exceptions I've discussed before is an incredibly beautiful and solid game.,Wargroove,1,
87,"2019-02-01",53,186,59,0,1,Medieval Advanced Wars with dogs.. If you like Turn Based Strategy Games you will love this game. I have bought this game on Nintendo Switch and on Steam.This is a majestic pixel game with a very good original soundtrack. One of the best turn based strategy games of the moment for me the best there is. If you are reading this review you want to know if the game is for you am I wrong? It does not matter if you are a child or an older person if you like strategy this game is for you it is quite complex in certain missions but you can reduce the level of difficulty to adapt it to you.And how many hours of play do you have? Almost infinite hours when you finish the campaign (which are quite a few hours) you have additional 1 player modes quite funny. But where you're really going to take time is in multiplayer between the maps created by the community and the wide repertoire of maps that come from the base game you'll have endless hours of fun.What are you waiting for? If you have read all this... it's because you are interested and the game is completely worthwhile and has a very low price.,Wargroove,1,
88,"2019-02-04",5,66,7,0,0,"While a good spirit successor to Advance Wars there are simply way to many hard counters (aka insta killing whole units) and not enough soft counters for me to give a positive rating. Spending moderate large amounts of gold only for it to instantly die do to several ""counters"" in the game heavily encourages reactionary play rather then any form of actual strategy as with current balancing picking the counter to whatever your enemy spawns is more far more effective then anything else. Perhaps in general lowering the damage output of all units by a small margin would fix this issue being able to react to your enemy rather then just rushing counter units to instantly kill whatever the enemy makes.",Wargroove,1,

148,"2017-03-02",0,0,10,1,1,Really impressed with this little program. The default wallpapers are nothing special but there are tons of free wallpapers available in the steam workshop. I have dual monitors and I can have seperate wallpapers on each. You can make playlists so the wallpapers cycle at timed intervals and a lot of the wallpapers can be customised with speed colours etc. Some wallpapers contain clocks and an audio triggered visualisation (one of these kept crashing my PC so be aware of that). Doesn't seem to use many resources even on high settings. The only downside is that using a 1440p monitor the content available is a little limited but over time more content should be available for this format. I found using 4k content or in some cases 1080p it looks good still. Well worth the price.,Wallpaper Engine,1,

The other issue that will happen will be the volume on all of them will randomly go back to 50. 2 things I think would make those headaches go away at least for me allowing a ""select all"" for the playlist and also adding a ""mute all"" other than that 100% love this app.",Wallpaper Engine,1,

259,"2018-05-02",579,456,128,1,1,Factorio is a puzzle game. The objective is supposedly to build a rocket ship to launch stuff into space but most people never get that far because they noticed that the last few furnaces in their smelter line aren't getting fed ore because the belt throughput isn't high enough so they need to upgrade the belts which requires more a lot more iron so they need to build more smelters and gear assemblers but then they start running out of iron so they need to build a new iron mine but there are bugs attacking their mining machines so they need to build turrets and ammunition and then they realize they need to get the ore from the new mine to their factory quicker so they need to build a train but then they need to do the same with their copper mine so they need to build a rail network that can cope with multiple automated locomotives without causing a traffic jam and they need to design rail intersections that don't allow crashes and then they realize that their power generation is starting to reach capacity so they need to upgrade their power plants so they decide to start using solar power but to use solar power properly you need batteries but to make batteries you need sulfur so they need to set up their oil refineries to make sulfur but then the heavy oil products are backing up because you have too much and you need steel production to build storage tanks and barrels for the oil but then you noticed that you don't have enough iron to make steel because your smelters are not running at full efficiency because there isn't enough belt throughput.,Factorio,1,

That says alot not just in the short time that I have owned the game but the fact that I have basically sold my soul to the devil to play this game as much as I have and I have no regrets doing so.The mods complete this game there are so many and so many good ones the community is awesome too.10/10 would sacrafice a feminist vegan to see this game in first person/3D/VR.,Factorio,1,
261,"2017-05-27",9,506,784,1,1,This isn't so much a game as it is a digital Zen Garden. I've lost hours (400+ apparently) tweaking my factory. Sometimes to make it look prettier. Sometimes to rebuild it because I need space for yeah another stream of components. Sometimes just because I've approached Zen and don't want to give it up.For every bottleneck in material flow you find and fix you'll create two more. And once you've got everything working perfectly Your factory will be stalled because of resource exhaustion spitters and bitters or a new production option changes your resource needs. If that sounds like the kind of challange you enjoy this game will provide you rediculous value for your money.,Factorio,1,

I find myself staring at different parts of it for a few moments it's captivating. Also frustrating when you thought something would work and it doesn't then you have to change your setup.I never built massive factories nor did I launch a rocket but I still enjoy making my factory grow modestly. Being attacked is an annoyance but wrecking the bugs' nests feels good...until they counterattack and wrecks your back.You will find yourself playing hours and hours day after day. And night after night you will dream of conveyor belts lots of conveyor belts.

A lot of fun comes from figuring out how to automate certain tasks and then how to link that automation with other automated parts. As the factory grows resources are depleted leaving room for more buildings while new resources must be secured and returned to the factory for processing. In the end everything gets messy and you have to modify your plans accordingly.You will always have something to do ),Factorio,1,
269,"2016-04-13",2458,1342,109,1,1,I started a co op factory with a close friend. After a day of work I stepped back looked at what we built and came to some realizations.1) I have no ing idea whats going on in this factory2) Half the components that directly interact with each other aren't even near one another one of the machines producing copper cable for another machine to assemble into circuit boards is halfway across the god damn refinery3) 90% of the conveyor belts are underground and the rest are going so many directions this thing looks like a ball of yarn4) There is coal ing EVERYWHERE5) I maintain enough sanity to count to 56) Staring at this thing makes my eyes itch7) Looking away makes my brain itchThe scariest part is that it keeps getting bigger and every time it gets bigger it somehow becomes MORE labrynthine. One of those ing conveyor belts goes all the way around the entire factory to deliver steel plates to a single assembler thats making bloody gears and its right next to the refinery itself!Sometimes the factory breaks. We don't usually notice because of how much of a mess this thing is and the breaks we do spot are often half an hour old and are a recurring problem. Rather than fix it we simply unjam the machine and ignore it until it breaks again. The biggest problem to fixing it comes from our production lines. Normal production lines look like a grid. Ours looks like you threw a bunch of squares into a bowl of spaghetti noodles and gave the bowl to a five year old for a period of one to five minutes. This proccess results in either an empty bowl and a full five year old a floor covered in noodles or spaghetti all over the walls and ceiling with the squares nowhere to be found. Knowing the trend in increasing chaos and complexity the factory exhibits probably all three.The factory is an empodiment of madness incomprehensible even to the men who built it laid every unholy circuit of conveyor belt a thousand arms madly spinning every second countless plates of copper and iron in a complex dance the likes of which is unseen in the realm of mere mortals. There are sections that I have no idea how they work and I BUILT THEM.The factory grows more complex with each passing second and more convoluted every milisecond. Perhaps the reason is in part due to each segment being constructed with no plans for future additions then the future additions were constructed by forcibly adapting the existing segments usually by shoving more tubes into it rather than actually redesigning it and these futrue additions are also not planned for expansion. The end result is a cluster so large in magnitude the last time a cluster rivaled it in size God smote the town and turned its inhabitants into salt. Unfortunately no god can save us from this... thing.Having expanded it further its almost as if the factory has a mind of its own an ever hungry consciousness burning with dark malevolence and the need to grow. It infects all who stand in its presence compelling them to add to it. A hundred furnaces belch smoke and the black blood of the earth is torn from its cradle to fuel the fires of industry. The ecosystem is demolished and the skin of the planet is rent and shattered for its glittering treasures tossed into the inferno of a thousand stone and metal prisons to be transformed used to expand the malignant blight upon the world that we brought. Ten thousand steel cogs turn and steam fills the air as the never ending fires boil the oceans away to power the sprawling spiderweb of mechanised mayhem ordered chaos at its purest a hundred thousand plates of steel and copper cycle and swirl in patterns barely knowable by the very people that created them.Each day the red and green fluids are pumped into glowing crystalline globes each sparking and burning discovering new knowledge and new machines. The factory grows. Each advance in technology only complicates matters. The factory grows. The new advances create a need for new resources. The factory grows. The new resources require new means of transportation. The factory grows. The new transportation feeds new machines that burn the new resources to produce blue fluids to discover new technology. The factory grows. The blue fluids feed the globes to reveal new truths beginning the vicious cycle anew a neverending circle of destruction and growth that will only end when every corner of the planet is scoured clean. The factory grows. The planet will never be scoured clean. The factory grows. The planet is infinite in size. The factory grows. The game will never be over.The factory grows.Epilogue // Date 6/21/ ERROR_NULL_VALUE Resources have dried up again. The factory consumes all within its reach insatiable in its hunger. Though it had experienced full production stoppages in the past the factory could never be eliminated from the planet by the natives for the sun itself powered the beams of destruction that maintained its borders. Within the creaking ancient cogs and permanent haze of foul and polluted smoke a single humanoid shape slowly rises to its feet. Aged failing flesh and bone long ago replaced with steel and chrome once polished and clean now weathered by uncountable years of exposure to acid rain and blackened by thick choking smog form its excuse for a body. It could have left while it was still human before it was consumed in body by the foundry it created to escape. It never had a chance to leave mind and soul devoured in the pursuit of freedom. With slow clanking steps and the steady drip of oil from its joints like a bleeding mechanical nightmare brought to hideous life it stands and rasps as it moves for the exit. Behind it a thousand drones rise like a plague of locusts ready to continue the endless harvest. As the abomination that was once a man steps towards the gates of the factory a mighty space faring vessel lies decrepit in its dry dock deep within the core of the facility. It was supposed to be a way off the planet the whole reason for the factory's construction. But soon the building of the factory became the means and the end no thought other than the constant urge to grow in its mind.The only machine resembling the human form in the entire world stepped out into the barren wasteland of the ruined world. A keening howling wind tears across the surface forests destroyed by the ruined atmosphere no longer keeping it in check.It is the cry of a dead world echoing forever on a planet overtaken by the machine.,Factorio,1,
270,"2016-05-18",0,0,541,1,1,One of the great ones.Inspired by resource manager games like Dwarf Fortress and Minecraft Factorio is an industry building RTS that takes the means of production to the extreme. The player is stranded on a hostile alien planet after a botched space colonization attempt. Using furnaces assembly machines an army of machines and more he strikes out against the endless alien swarm in every direction. Yet the biters and spitters are enraged by his factories' pollution and attack from every direction.In a nutshell Excellent RTS resource management game developed by an independent studio based in the EUGreat community though not very largeMultiplayer support still in the works but this should be an excellent game with other peopleWell optimized game runs very wellBig updates in the worksSome downsides Tedious game play essentially this game puts into into an infinite management loop forcing you to continually jump through hoops that force you to expand your production.Poor mod multiplayer support at the time of writing steam workshop and servers have not been integrated into the game's system. It's currently easiest as a single player game.Rating 94/100,Factorio,1,
271,"2018-01-23",19,582,9567,1,1,"Coming up to 5000 hours playing this game and im still learning new things in multiplayer. The devs are by far the best ive ever seen. FFF (Friday Fun Facts) is a blog post they write up every Friday. Every. Single. Friday. For the last ... 4 years? look at them on their website its not a 2 min blurb its a full review of what they've done that week and where they're headed what their plans are current iterations they're going over complete with pictures and sometimes *chuckle* hand drawn graphs. Their IRC channel (there is a link on their website) has someone on the dev team there pretty much 24/7. Not just ""community manager"" nitwits (Trangar te he) but guys like Rseding91 (their C++ guru) that are programming the actual updates. Oh. There are updates.Are there sometimes bugs in the patches? Sure. Which is why you sometimes see 2 patches in the same day. Bugs get quashed immediately whenever possible. While this review doesnt speak much about the game the team behind it deserves the recognition its amazing thoughtul and incredibly well done because of them.In a nutshell its similar to RTS games like starcraft where you build up and gather resources. But instead of spending 20 minutes to build up a base to have the game end in 2 you keep building.Building Bigger.Making things more efficient.Tearing down and rebuidling.Im almost 5000 hours in and sticking with vanilla until I can personally say Ive mastered it. Once I stop learning new things almost every time I play ill start fooling around with mods. And there are lots of them. Is this game worth $20? It absolutely was for me. This single $20 purchase brought me thousands of hours of entertaintment frustration when things didnt work planned and absolute delight when things get fixed and I can reflect on my orchestra of 500 machines working in harmony.

Some have been challenging or amazing or addictive or simply awesome. But there's been two that beat all others by lengths Diablo II and Factorio. When you can't wait to get home turn on your rig and immerse yourself in the wonderful world of Sanctuario or some distant hostile planet you had just crashed on.Factorio is not about aliens or warfare. It's all about base building resource management and automation. Aliens and warfare just add another challenge. The actual challenge comes from figuring out a better more efficient way. It's about calculating ratios optimizing routes to and from your storages. Building better setups. More often than not you will find that ""better"" has to include ""better looking"". It's the perfect game for challenging your OCD (watch any of Nilaus' videos).The game itself is still in Early Access (as of October 2018) but is already the most polished and bug free game I've ever played. Yes it's only 2D. Graphics is meh. But boy it more than makes up for in gameplay. Another great advantage of the top down view is its speed. Even with literally tens of thousands of entities it runs so freaking smooth. And it's highly addictive. The well known ""just one more move"" translates to Factorio's ""let me just finish this setup real quick to step up my production of iron gear wheels"".Pros Addictive game play. Ridiculously low price. No microtransactions. Polished. Bugs (almost) not existing. It has trains! It has flying robots that construct stuff for you!

A game that is survival but you can thrive instead of just surviving by making robots and machines do everything for you. I have already recomended this game to 5 or 6 of my friends. If you have the money and like using your brain to overcome problems and build things BUY THIS GAME!The good Great for unlimited play. There is always more to do. Multiplayer is super fun and much less laggy then anticipated. The enemy progression system is near perfect Runs very well even with over 300 robots all doing different things on the screen. Very customisable world Very smooth controls The combat robots are awesome Modules and suit upgrades out the wazoo The logic systems and rail systems are very polished and well done Most early access games I have played I have found many bugs. I have not found a single bug in this game. The blueprint system is easy efficiant and well done. Robots are very polished and do what they're supposed to very well. Devs are awesome! Best builder/tower defence game I have ever playedCould use some work Vehicles are a little sub par but still fun to use Armor augmentatin system is a little broken. I should not be able to run faster then a train or take on a max level enemy base with a shotgun Inserter speed is limited for extreme late game. I found myself needing 2 or 3 fast inserters just to load enough copper into one assembler for wire lack of enemy types Water and lake boundries and some way to clear them or build over them. not many methods of producing powerThe Bad (most being fixed in updates coming soon most likely) A lack of end game. Once the rocket is launched you have nothing else to progress too aside from expanding your current base. Weapons. There are 6 weapons in the game 3 are and one is god tier will most likely be balanced soon.Things I would personally like to see/Pipe dreams A gamemode or checkbox of ""Extreme survival"" requiring you to eat drink and sleep through nights. Enemies may have more advanced AI in this gamemode. Space. Although this is a little far fetched add the ability to set up a space station mine astroids or even moons. Or even travel to a different planet all together. Including a sort of out of atmosphere solar panel which was what I thought the satalite was going to do. More biomes. Some biomes containing different enemy types or some having extreme tempatures that require a suit module to survive in but also much richer in resources More power production methods! Nuclear power for examble. A sort of ""Deep mining"" drill. A drill that extracts ore from deep underground in a much slower power consuming fassion. This could also be a good way to get end game ore. End game ore. Uranium Diamond Platinum. An enemy ""Hive Mind"". Sort of like the worms that spawn only huge. Controlls the underlings and directs them. Destroy hive mind end all sort of alien attacks in that biome. Destroying the hive mind would need to be extreamly difficult. Air vehices. I would love to be able to quickly get around the base or area without worrying about hitting a pipe or electrical pole. Also including a ""Sky transport"" like a end game train that does not need tracks. Differenty types of miners more suitable and productive for late game. The ability to grow trees and cut them down and produce charchoal from the wood leading to a renewable source of coal. Crops either to eat and regain health or to use as bio fuel. More and more exotic types of weapons. We have the alien artifacts why not use them to make an acid launcher or a plasma beam? More natual fluids aside from water. Have a rarer type of volcanic biome that produces lava which can be used to power thermal generators. More enemies! More powerfull versions of the origional enemies. A type of behomoth biter multiplied by 5. Flying enemies subterainian enemies water based enemies enemy base levels producing higher level enemies and giving more artifacts when destroyed. Some drop from basic enemies. Chitin used for armor Meat used to cook Spitter acid as an alternate use to make batteries or poison bullets worm teeth for drill augmentations the list goes on. Robot companions. Robots that help you with things other then fighting for 120 secconds or building stuff. Neutral mosters. Things like wild space animals that don't want to kill you. Possibly tamable and kept as a pet or something More train types! Trains requiring advanced fuel or even magnetic trains that travel hundreds of miles an hour. Teleporters(?) requring disgusting amounts of power but able to transfer anything including items over great distances instantly. Cound even include coming from space or an astroid to the home world requiring some sort of airlock. Pressure chambers! Pressurising air to make types of materials like alloys or more compressed liquids. Steam workshop support! There are a lot of great mods out there and the steam workshop just makes them accessed easier. PvP or factions maybe? Proximity voice chat?Simply put I love this game.

Then you plonk down a machine that starts mining iron ore for you and you feed the result into a furnace. You build more machines then some inserters. More machines and it becomes easier to link up a few things with conveyor belts.Four hours later you look down on a factory system so complex you couldn't have designed it and yet it grew so gradually so organically that at no point you felt overwhelmed.You look at the time maybe ten more minutes you want to quickly redesign this bit around your assemblers to fit in another conveyor belt. It would speed up the production of green electronic circuits.Three hours later you realize that you should have been in bed for hours but you can't stop now you just build a tank and you really want to try it out on that alien base that has been growing way too much.Factorio is fun.

As the trailer demonstrates you can eventually create advanced weaponry vehicles trains and huge self running factories whose main goal is to support your industrial hunger.I wasn't sure if I was happy about the 2D sprite graphics at first but to be honest it makes so much more sense to make this game in 2D rather than complex 3D as it makes it so much more charming and gives it this old school Starcraft feel as well especially since you'll get zerged by aliens a lot.So here's a thing there are a native species on the planet that don't really mind you as much until you start polluting the planet. As soon as the smoke chimneys go up and trees start dying that's when you can expect to get your alien friends to come for a visit. Which is why you're given quite an arsenal of various guns and turrets that can be automated as well. But in all honesty this game is not for the weak of heart or mind. All of the resources are limited and you only get one life. If you die the game is over and you will have to either reload an old save or start from scratch depending on the difficulty mode. Other than that this game also includes an extensive research tree a campaign mode with storyline and a very detailed tutorial a puzzle mode where you are given limited resources or space to solve various problems and there's even multiplayer!All in all for the price I think this game is definitely worth it.In summary PRO original crafting dynamicstons of toolsvehiclesgoal driven but also sandboxypuzzle modesmultiplayergood musicmod friendlyhuge educational potentialCON graphics may be disappointing for somecombat is very simplifiedchallenging...actually this could be a PROno respawns (permadeath),Factorio,1,

THIS NEEDS WORK DEVS FIX THIS!!ok after 7 hours of playingshort version you like to wait for a bus to show up? you like standing around doing nothing? youd like to play a game where you hit one button then go do some laundry not playing the game? then THIS IS FOR YOU!!! waiting simulator 2016 build a base with interesting ideas and automate stuff then when you get gun turrets and walls automate the research items and go do something else while the game takes 45 mins to complete one thing and you do nothing but wait around!!its ok not great as people say research IS WAYYYYYY TOOOO SLOOOOWWWWW the 7 hours ive played ive researched like 6 things with multiple labs ive just finished cars i even upgraded the labs twice STILL too slow with 40% increase its a good 30 35 min wait for stuff to finish. automation isnt efficient at all it NEEDS to have the arms put more materials into the devices for production. the top of the supply chain is scarce with materials while the bottom is overly abundant! the game pauses when looking on the research screen which is dumb. it has a big tech tree but becaue of the speed at which it takes no crap people have like 40+ hours on the game its probably only one scenario!!! enemy ai will harrass you which is nice to have some combat but for the most part youll rig up an auto research machine and do nothing the whole time while waiting for research to finish. co op would probably make it worse with 3 4 people standing around waiting for research to finish! needs drastic improvements 5/10,Factorio,1,

387,"2016-03-11",4,3,246,1,1,Factorio is an extremely addictive game about automation the goal is to build a spaceship that requires a lot of resources to build and you wont be able to do it with your bare hands so the point of the game is to build massive factories to create all the neccessary components to build the spaceship(or more factories) all while fighting off hordes of aliens who hate pollution and want to put a stop to your antics.Id highly recommend this game to people who are into resource management and automation games its in early access but there is already so much to do that its worth its price tag and each new update only adds more to its potential playtime.,Factorio,1,
388,"2016-11-26",0,0,109,1,1,Really addicting! Only thing I would change is the syncing of achievements to steam when mods are installed... Definitely would recommend this to anyone who loves puzzles!,Factorio,1,
389,"2016-08-12",0,0,378,1,1,"This is a builder game but on a scale not typically seen. You start off small chopping trees and digging coal out of the dirt by hand. You quickly get set up with a machine to automatically mine and start smelting some iron. Then you make something that automatically moves the iron to your smelter. Then you research a machine to construct items for you. Then you automatically move your iron copper and stone through appropriate smelters on to assemblers that make more assemblers smelters miners and things that move items around. Then you make trains to supply your smelters from far away. Then you build robots that can simplify your supply chain within your factory by moving items between any two points as needed. Then you build power armor and carry the robots with you. Then you have them build entire solar farms in seconds from components built automatically in your factories. Eventually you've built enough infrastructure that you're measuring your iron consumption in hundreds or thousands *per second* and start launching rockets into space on a regular basis. About the only thing you can't automate is deciding where/how to expand your base.It's rather telling that it takes literally millions of item crafts to launch your first rocket but it can be played indefinitely with as few as 101 of those crafts being performed manually and speed runners can beat the game in a couple hours.The way it manages to transition you between these stages without telling you what to do is rather fantastic albeit rough at times as you struggle to figure out the best way to lay out your factory. My only significant complaint is that proper management of trains is decidedly unintuitive. Or rather it doesn't give good feedback on *why* it's failing if a train can't find a path. But this game has already improved over time in so many other areas that I can't see that being a problem forever. And once you find a pattern that works the game has built in capabilities for copy pasting your designs elsewhere so you don't have to worry about it anymore.Oh and there are aliens to fend off the entire time you're doing this so good luck with that (though you can technically choose to play with them on ""peaceful"" so that they will not attack first.)If you're worried about getting bored don't be. There is a very healthy mod scene in this game with mods adding everything from tameable aliens to dozens of ore types to entirely restructuring the tech tree to make them game 5 times as long. And the game itself isn't done yet of course with plans to eventually expand out beyond your initial planet.TL DR If you like builder games you'll love this. Just be prepared to voluntarily lose some sleep.",Factorio,1,

400,"2016-04-08",0,0,163,1,1,"ABOUTFactorio is a game about building and creating automated factories to produce items of increasing complexity within an infinite 2D world. Use your imagination to design your factory combine simple elements into ingenious structures and finally protect it from the creatures who don't really like you.What I thinkA friend linked me this game a few days ago and I was intrigued. My initial thoughts after viewing the trailer was ""Trains? Aliens to defend yourself from? Largescale factories built within an infinite 2D world? Wow! I must buy it! Factorio has been out for years which if I had've known it existed sooner I surely would have bought it.Your first thoughts when looking at Factorio might be ""Another Early Access game? Ugh!"" or ""The price of this 2D Early Access game seems high.."" Let me clarify It took my friends &amp I 103 hours to finish the game. That includes sleeping regular breaks playing everyday for hours etc. Few days ago when I bought the game until now I have over 80+ hours with still much more I want to do in Factorio. Factorio has replay value and is well worth $20+ especially how much content it has in it already.Factorio has procedural generation (infinite random world to explore) and different biomes. With that in mind that also includes an infinite amount of alien hives and aliens. Yes aliens. They don't like you and you shouldn't like them. Build defenses to keep those buggers out or go out on foot on an adventure to conquer as many as you'd like! Either way you'll have your hands tied in the process.The basics of the game is easy to learn never hard. Mine and chop to gain resources and craft hundreds of items to build your factory. Make your factory automatically work by logistics and/or the circuit network that way you won't have to lift a finger again when it comes to crafting.There's more to the game I just summed up basic gist of the game and how great it is.Endless possibilities endless world endless factory and endless gameplay all in one 2D package.Rating 10/10",Factorio,1,

Remember the addiction of building huge factories to automate production of things and feeling accomplished in it?Welcome to factorio a game where you can really do what you wish as it is a sandbox with no real story (unless you play the campain) and a major learning curve. Once you got the basics down prepare your because biters will try and penetrate your every night and as your pollution goes up from the massive factory you made that just makes them want you more ( ʖ ). BUT WAIT THERES MORE! You just ran out of recourses so you are butt ed untill you get a train system up to ship materials back to your hub base. Once you think you beat all the biters and mobs and resupplied your base you discovered that OH WAIT the biters can rellocate if you don't commit genocide on them.

433,"2019-01-03",0,0,142,0,1,"The insurgency series are similar to squad and arma games but with the fluid movement and accessible mechanics of more arcade like shooters. But make no mistake insurgency is brutal. Headshots are a thing but they matter much less as 2 body shots will almost always take someone down the ""time to kill"" is very low for all weapons. It's hard to describe the brutality and unforgivingness of insurgency but it is easily understood when starting out. You will die. A lot. And hence you'll have to adapt your behaviour to a more realistic one you'll run from cover to cover stay away from doorways choose not to engage some enemies and stick with your teammates. If squad and arma are just a bit too slow for you but you enjoy the realism this game is for you. Sandstorm improves on its predecessors in visual quality spectacular sound and effects and adds an albeit at the moment rather limited customization system based on in game tokens that can only be earned in game (no bought). After a few hours you'll probably have an outfit of your choice for both teams it's no grind.

While updates have been slow coming they've been incrementally helpful and sanity saving. If you enjoy faced paced gameplay combined with heart pounding realism and top notch sound design look no further.,Insurgency: Sandstorm,1,

479,"2018-12-22",0,0,44,0,1,"The best game that came out in the last 2 years honestly. In the last 2 years games came out and that boring BR trend. After one year that trend became for me boring af. This game however I didn't expect I will like it so much. What I love about that game is that he is diffrent from most games and he is the best ""Reality Tactical Shooter FPS Game"" Ever made. I don't know how to expline what I love about this game but one thing for sure that I like about this game is that I love how when someone shots you your charchter shouts and saying like ""You ing prick"" Idk I just love it. If you don't love games that the Time To Kill very fast and it's slow mostly so don't buy it. There is alot of intersting mechenics aswell for exemple the weight system The more you carry the slower you will move It makes the game alot better and fun to play. One problam I have is the optimizianton It could be better. And the sound I personally can't Pin Point were enemeys are coming from. But overall this game is rly rly good and I highly recommend it.

494,"2018-12-28",0,0,63,0,1,Played every single day since release. Game rocks. There are some issues with it but they'll iron it out soon.Sound design and animations and level of detail is out of this world. This game has the most realistic gunshots and explosions in any game ever. Play this game loud enough you're gonna have people screaming to death burning alive and the dull thud of obliterated body parts hitting the wall embedded in your head for a long time.Map design could use some love since visually maps are quite similar which is fitting since the theme is Insurgency but since this game has well lit interiors quite unlike the labyrinthian campfests of the previous Insurgency But I had 24 hours in that game so clearly I am not the best person to talk about it. Gamemodes Push is still chaotic fun which is quite amplified with the Commander system. However your team might be idiotic sometimes and have no Commander or no Observer. Or your Observer might be running off. Or you might be unfortunate enough to play as a non Chinese speaker in a Chinese server because the game does not differentiate between SEA and EAS servers. Firefight is in regular versus but in the Competitive mode it is pure gold. Skirmish is okay for the most part.All in all great game might get even better in the upcoming years.

498,"2018-12-28",0,0,0,0,0,"In general im sure it can be a decent game but the amount of camping Mic spammers and uninteresting setting and factions were a huge turnoff. You might argue that ""Camping"" is necissary in games like this which i can agree to an extent. But when its to the point where literally every member of the defending team is just sitting in the corners of one house with nobody roaming its just frustrating. Combined with how un useful the people online happen to be it just ends up being a mess and the maches play out like Counter Strike ARMA Also im going to vent a little on my views on having the middle east as the theme. It's so oversaturated and such a boring setting its almost laughable that shooters choose it as a base. Sand rocks some vegetation and those yellowish white stone houses from tatooine. Mix up the design and you have literally every map in the game besides your generic middle eastern city/Bazaar map that i never played but am sure is in here right along with its other Generic middle eastern inspired maps.The factions also could not find a way to make themselves more boring either. ""Security forces"" literally makes me laugh whenever this joke of a faction is used in games might as well be a bunch of white faceless humaniod models with guns vs a blue group of faceless humaniod models with guns. It's boring when you use a legitimate entity for example the US Marines or the German KSK it gives you a side to root for and gives a ""Face to the name"" so to speak. I like to think about the setting and whats happening throughout the battles for immersions sake but this just seems pointless. I also dont like the fact that the insurgent forces have to be based on the taliban how about somethign new? IRA maybe? Or atleast design them like a literal military force and not people in Polos and sandals with a gunbelt and mask. If you look at militant groups in the middle east you can see that they generally do have some form of uniformity beyond civilian clothes with a mask and gunbelt. Also in terms of tech it ran OK with stutters here and there and a bit of screen tearing this was on a 1060 6gb on high settings so take it how you will. I stood a fairly stable 60 FPS but there was a problem with other players stuttering alot while running and appearing to fall through floors while prone.If you have a group you can play this with im sure it would be fun but if you dont have a group to play it with i wouldnt bother. If you're looking for a legit MilSim experience try something like Squad. If you want Arma counterstrike this might fit you well too.",Insurgency: Sandstorm,1,

503,"2019-01-03",0,0,172,0,1,Best tactical shooter I've ever played. But it has some optimization issues.The gameplay is intense and brutal. The map design is excellent and the maps are far bigger than the original Insurgency maps. Calling fire support as a commander and observer is very satisfying. Players are generally rewarded with more kills and fewer deaths by playing methodically as a team But I wish there were game mechanics in place to reward teamplay with bonuses (as Commanders and Observers need to pair up to call in fire support for example I wish Riflemen could quickly mark enemy positions for machinegunners and in turn the machinegunners could suppress enemy positions for the Riflemen).Adding some additional weapon attachments would be great (I miss flashlights). Finally I wish they'd fix the optimization issues and add some extra maps for variety.Overall fantastic game. You'll die a lot at first.

I haven't had this much fun playing a game since PUBG first came out in 2017 so it's been a while since i'vebeen able to say that i truely enjoy this game. If you like FPS with a good challenge try this out. The only things i can think of that need improvement are that it doesn't seem well optimised even for my RTX 2080 which seems like it should be able to handle this at 1440p on the highest settings but oh well. If you have anything below a 1070 tuirn the effects all the way down shadows down foliage to medium and you should have a really good experience at 1080p and 1440p.,Insurgency: Sandstorm,1,

507,"2018-12-26",0,0,16,0,1,"Overview Insurgency Sandstrom is what you would kind expect from an Insurgency game. Highly realistic and team communication and patience is a nesarcy need to survive. It all pretty fun but i'm kinda torn on whether or not to recommend this to old Insurgency player and even some new ones. Gameplay It takes the major mechanics of the first and puts them into sandstrom expect for different types of ammo you can buy like in the first game why did they take this out? I have no idea but anyway the game feels way bigger with larger maps vehicle additions like the truck with a mounted machine gun and even takes the commander machancie from DOI and puts it in the game so you can call various airstrikes to aid your teammates mid game (or just get them killed). This games lack of telling you weather you have killed or even hit them can be difficult for you to tell whether someone is dead or if your bullets even registered to kill the guy. I feel as if this can be a turn off when we are spoiled with hitmarkers and kill feeds but it fits the realistic tone very well. So if you like realism this shouldn't be a problem. Guns and throwables feel great and are very well animated. Classes are like DOI with different guns and some exclusive guns for certain classes. It all fits together really well and with a more updates and balancing the game has the potential of surpassing its predecessor. Graphics and Optimization I'm gonna be honest I can't get a very good framerate above low settings with a GTX 1070 and while I can get above 75 frames at times this games optimization needs a lot of tweaking so people without over specced rigs can enjoy a stable frame rate with some decent graphics. So I can't tell you much from first hand how the ""Ultra"" graphics look but I have seen some videos and it looks very detailed and nice but low settings looks horrible but I can't go above low without wanting to scratch my eyeballs out. But the dev team have stated that this is a major concern of theirs and it will be worked on. Now maybe if the Hunt Showdown team could say the same thing.... Side Notes Game has no story modeCommunity can be cancerous at timesA lot more customization options then DOI and InsurgencyGame has some bugs (Getting stuck in the ground Missing hands etc.)Over all the game in its current state has down its gameplay and the content is limited but so was DOI and Insurgency it's all about experiences. I feel if the games optimization gets major updates and soon the game will run at a buttery smooth fps then I can say this game is a must buy but until then just be warned this game has issues but is still being supported. So if you want to put up with some bull crap and you love the last Insurgency then I say more power to you.",Insurgency: Sandstorm,1,

522,"2019-01-04",0,0,106,0,1,I haven't played the first Insurgency so some of these points may be intentionally ignored by the developers. But let's get the bad things out first maps and weapons are rather limited molotov and incendiary grenade effects are simplistic water should slow you down and make more noise when interacted with character sometimes gets stuck on obstacles you would normally just walk over without much effort character sometimes starts spawning in with invisible hands so you are running around with a floating weapon in front of you being a hardcore kind of realistic shooter I would have expected character animations to be more fluid. I do not know if this could actually be implemented but I would love it if players had a maximum rotation speed that resembles a real human bodyNow the reasons you should definitely get into it + gunplay is good maybe the recoil should be even more severe especially on full auto especially on the 7.62 caliber weapons like G3 which kicks like a mule in real life+ magazine management and reloads are absolutely fantastic this is how it should be in every game+ the audio in this game is generally spot on I don't think I have ever had a more realistic experience in a video game+ the AI in cooperative mode is usually competent enough and offers a challenge there are times where they swarm you like crazy rarely they 360 no scope you from 200 meters rarely they become oblivious to their surroundings+ the competition is tough my first games I went into PVP and got my handed to me real hard by people sniping you from some secret spot halfway across the map or getting the drop on you from some roof you gotta move from cover to cover and consider sneaking when indoors+ the commander and observer duo is nice you sometimes get a bad partner who ignores the objective and starts chasing kills but generally it is fun I imagine it is more useful in competitive games where your team avoids charging into artillery fire but I do not trust myself to try ranked battles yet+ mature community,Insurgency: Sandstorm,1,

It is not a computer problem since i can run Escape From Tarkov which is an intense game for a computer to handle at smooth 60 fps. Whilst this game gives me 5 15 fps and sometimes 60 fps for around three seconds before the fps itself again. I have now set everything to low but it didnt affect the fps in any way. I really hope that this gets fixed in the full release otherwise i have just wasted my money on an unplayable game.Seems like an awesome game otherwise 10/10 would recommend.This issue might only occur for me though so if you are planning to buy the game please do not let this review tear your opinions down.,Insurgency: Sandstorm,1,
525,"2018-12-26",0,0,69,0,1,"This is one of the best shooters I've ever played. I've always felt like Arma modded pvp is the gold standard in tense/heartpounding firefights with other players that will make you jump in your seat when someone fires a round at you and make you feel insanely good when you kill someone. Gunfights feel heartpoundingly tense like they do In pvp Arma. For anyone coming from Battlefield I can tell you that this game manages to provide that intense shooting experience at higher levels than Battlefield 5 and it does this with fewer accoutrements than what Battlefield puts on the maps (tanks planes etc.). Insurgency does have air support but it works much differently than other games like BF. Suffice it to say it's well implemented and balanced and it adds lots of intensity to the experience.Every gunfight feels intense. Your aim is truly important in this game but even more so is your reaction time. I am not knocking Battlefield or COD or doing any of that kind of childish ""my game is better than yours"" kind of bs. But in my opinion this is the game you want to play if you like a hardcore game focused on teamwork skill and intense close quarters combat.One important thing for me is that all guns gear etc. are unlocked from the beginning. You don't have to grind for weeks like in other games to unlock that weapon that everyone else who got there first is using to mow you down. Nope just pick your loadout and go. The currency you earn for playing the game is used to buy cosmetics for your character.There is no killcam (thank god). The game intentionally lacks some things like ammo count in your mag to focus the experience more to the hardcore. Be mindful of when to reload. Be mindful of whether or not you've even loaded a mag in the magwell. I love the fact that if you start reloading and then immediately start doing something else like climbing over a ledge or sprinting you will not load the mag in and you will need to leave some time to actually put a mag in at some point. Features like this make the experience feel hardcore and authentic. It's features like this that make the experience feel deep. Reloading a mag in the heat of things is a serious decision. Pulling out your grenade to throw it in a tight spot is a serious decision. Everything you do feels important to your success.Lastly I have to point out how amazing the sound is in this game. Earlier I stated that this game provides that feeling of a big battlefield fight but it does so without all the tanks and planes and stuff that a game like BF has. It does this with some of the best sound effects in a shooter I've ever heard. Prepare your ears because things that should be loud and deafening are loud and defeaning. When things are quiet you will hear footsteps around you. When explosions are going off and there is mass confusion you will understand what I am talking about with the sound design. Every sound effect in this game is on point.This game is well worth the price if you're looking for a very tight shooting experience. If you've never played something like this it will feel difficult at first but stick it out. This game will reward your patience in learning the maps learning how to move and when to push or hold position and learning the gun recoil etc. etc.",Insurgency: Sandstorm,1,

549,"2018-12-26",0,0,48,0,1,The sound effects are just on point. You really need play this game with headphones to appreciate the sound design. Gunfights are awesome and the guns are pretty well balanced.I usually play public matches in AS servers but I find the US servers are better to play at due to the fact that almost 90% of the time I played in AS servers most of my teams are Chinese players that I can't understand whatever it is they say in comms. However I get about 200 ping in US servers which kinda bad.A thing I hate about this game are the restricted areas. Sometimes you have the perfect opportunity to outflank the enemy but then you find yourself in the restricted zone and end up getting f*cked by the enemy team.I hope they continue to add more features in the game like other maps dynamic weather night maps. The night maps on Insurgency (Source) were awesome! You get to utilize NODs and flashlights with your loadouts.Buy and try this game. ),Insurgency: Sandstorm,1,

559,"2018-12-27",0,0,55,0,1,One of the best FPS out right now Emphasis on teamwork you can have the most kills and be at the bottom of the scoreboard the person with the least kills can be the teams MVP if they capture and defend objectives. The gunplay in this game is very realistic a single round is enough to drop even the most heavily armored players The downtimes between respawns and getting back into the action is minimal for a team objective game however dying does feel consequensial enough to force you to adopt different strategys instead of trying to brute force your way to victory the same exact way every single time. A well hidden lone enemy sniper could be the factor that causes a team to avoid an entire side of a map. The recoil on guns in this game is substantial and makes gameplay more chalanging. No more call of duty spray and pray full auto bursts from the AK are difficult to control like they should be. Bullet penetration is perfect a perfectly viable strategy is to take a LMG and turn a building into swiss cheese and absent any kill feeds or hit markers you will be greeted by the corpses of the enemy team and a lone enemy tucked into the one corner laying in ambush that your machine gun fire didnt hit.I highly reccomend this game its providing way more enjoyment than any of the AAA shooters that cost twice as much (Black Ops4 Battlefield V).,Insurgency: Sandstorm,1,
560,"2019-01-03",0,0,35,0,1,Okay so I see that there are quite a few people who aren't happy with the game because of things like performance and bugs. I just want to adress these topics in a quick and helpful review based upon what I have experienced within the game. So yes the FPS does drop and stutter sometimes. I believe this to be due to lots of smoke grenades going off at the same time or just lots of stuff happening in general. However for me (I should note that I have a fairly good Mid High range PC) these FPS drops and stutters do not happen too often. There are also things like Graphics loading at the lowest setting when you respawn. To clarify most of the time when you respawn the graphics look really low res like lots of pixels and crap. However this problem fixes itself quite quickly and they return to the setting you have them on. I believe this is due to the engine they are using. The way I see it the game doesnt load the entire map in high res because that would reduce performance. So instead it loads the textures around you as you move around just enough that you dont notice. However it also does this when you are spectating someone so when you respawn all of a sudden you switch to a position where the game hasnt loaded the textures so they are low res. If you dont beleive me try switching players quickly when you are spectating. The same thing happens with the textures. I feel that the spectator camera hasnt been that well implemented into the game however hopefully this will be fixed later on.Next topic is the bugs. Things like guns and bodies getting stuck in walls and occasionally things like your hands and guns failing to load. I have experienced all of those bugs and to be honest are they annoying? Not really however the hands one does annoy me somewhat. But that can be fixed. I just want to note that is it a game? Yes. Have you ever played a game that had absolutely no bugs in it on release? I know I haven't. It's a game that just came out of early access. Expect bugs to be in it. Sure they delayed it 2 months but I feel that was for performance of the game. My point is bugs can usually be fixed quite easy nowadays so there's no point complaining unless it is a complete game breaking bug that should have been found and fixed by now.In conclusion is Sandstorm a good game? I think it is despite the obvious problems with the engine. The audio and visual effects of the game are absolutely stunning and I still somehow find an excuse to play the game for a little longer every time. There is no way to describe the feeling you get when you watch the A 10 strafe a target area. If you are a person who will not tolerate one or any of the things I mentioned above then you may want to hold off this game for now. If you are like me and you dont mind bugs unless they break the game then I would say make sure your computer can run it well and buy it.,Insurgency: Sandstorm,1,

584,"2018-12-27",0,0,4,0,0,DO NOT LISTEN to these positive reviews. Here's a critical honest to god hard look at Insurgency Sandstorm.Positives (some of these are small but important for the type of game this is)Great graphics (if you can load them in)Heavy and immserive adrenaline filled combatAmazing sound designDynamic maps well thought outGood weapon selection interesting to switch upNegatives Optimization is awful (I have a 1050Ti) Graphics look like clay for a few seconds upon respawning/loading in/etc. Massive stutter I've never gotten 60 fpsRECOIL IS TOO HIGH I've shot guns in real life the recoil in this game is overexaggerated I've heard someone say that your in game character is in an intense situation so they'd have less control of their recoil but that's just an excuse. That's just a nitpick to try to justify a nonsensical mechanic in the game. Take Escape From Tarkov an extremely realistic game the devs shoot the guns in real life and replicate them in their game to best of their ability and it's far superior to Insurgency Sandstorm. Insurgency Sanstorm's gun mechanics do not make sense. Movement and looking around is the worst I've seen. Walking feels like sliding on ice you barely feel like you have any control over your character VERY unresponsive. Looking around is just poorly implemented it feels like I'm using an outdated security camera with a laggy connection.Generally uncomfortable to play. In a sense where and this leads back to the movement and so on the game doesn't feel right. It needs polishing. Not ready for release.I realize there are more positives than negative but it's impossible to pay attention to them because the negatives are so impactful to the actual gameplay.I came here from the original Insurgency expecting this game to be an ultimate step up from that game but it is simply not. Youtubers over glorify this game (and make it look not laggy because they have the best graphics cards) call it realistic but it's not realistic it's very arcade like actually more so than the original Insurgency. If you want something realistic go to Arma 3 EFT Squad Post Scriptum. If some of this sounds bias I apologize but I'm royally off after giving this game 3 chances each being 1 2 (approximately) hour play sessions. This game is not worth it.,Insurgency: Sandstorm,1,

599,"2018-12-31",0,0,61,0,1,"Really good game in the series. So far started with a mod then a stand alone and now this version.One thing I'll say to start the base of the game is complete but the game needs polishing. It needs much more fine tuning and optimization in order to run better which is fair considering the team previously worked using the source engine and the one currently being used is Unreal 4.It's a game I'd recommend buying but in it's current state one you'd want to wait for a steam sale for. It's worth the buy but not at a regular game price considering it's playability issues.Secondary issues being map errors. All the maps have a ""no go"" zone for your team in the enemy area which feel in some cases misplaced on certain maps or some spots missed all together. There's a location even on a map where you can get in behind the enemy team's spawn point and be allowed to shoot which some people exploit.Another issue I run into consistantly is when items are on the ground it's sometimes fickle about how close you need to be to pick them up. Some cases I can be at muzzle length to pick it up in other cases I have to be literally right ontop of it to pick it up which sometimes puts me in the scope of an enemy player.Other than that the game is fun. I enjoy it as a ""3rd"" installment of the game. This makes for a great sequel and has been done pretty well it just needs more work to iron out the wrinkles. Once that's been done and it runs properly the game could easily out do the previous installment.",Insurgency: Sandstorm,1,

I had a lot of fun and loged 30+ hours on their first Insurgency game and they really stepped up their game with this new instalment. It's like a merge of Battlefeild and Arma 3 yet it still keeps the Insurgency roots. I love the co op and the competitive multyplayer and the game makes you feel like your really in a battle or firefight. I love the firearms and the nades/explosives feel real with all the debris and dust. There were moments where I felt panic courage fear and bravery all at the same time. I love this game and I hope that the devs keep this game relivent. I did however run into a glitch where my fellow teammate went invisable but it was not game breaking and it was rather funny.You can also roleplay as a tactical bada** or a goofy non serious player. This is a great game and it's an easy 9/10.Edited noteThe game still has some bugs and it still needs some work. I encountered a glitch where my main guy went transparent and it was just his mind powers holding up the firearm. That was odd but not game breaking. This is also not as refined as their first game Insurgency but thats to be expected. I will update this if I encounter any new bugs.,Insurgency: Sandstorm,1,

622,"2018-12-30",0,0,17,0,1,I just started to play and for now I'm playing pve as I wanna learn maps before diving into pvp so take this review as partial.Overall this game is awesome. Matchmaking is extremely fast ingame voice comm is well made and even if it's not used a lot (at least in the games I played so far) it's usefull.Bot skill is not that much you can easily get 30 1 if you know the map and play smart. Beside that winning is not always grant as not dying ain't equal to winning )Technically speaking this is a UE4 game so it's well polished and visually cool. The downside is that optimization is not at it's best. I'm suffering some framedrops w/ Vega64 and R5 2600 and this is not cool. Anyways I always play above 120fps with minor drops to 80 in some occasion.If you like CoD don't buy this game.If you like BF3+ just come and play some serious infantry mess.If you like CS well I don't play CS since 1.6 so I can't tell but I think you'll like it anyways.and if you seriously want to like WW3 but for now you hate it because of the crashes and amazon gamelift hosting you are in business! )By the way you can run your own community server on baremetal hosted vps or you can rent a game server on major providers at mid price. This is cool it is clear that devs are coming from source world and are open minded.EAC is the AC platform (same as ww3) I don't know how effective it is as I didn't play any ranked or pvp but it's good to know.I'll update this as soon as I get some pvp or ranked match.,Insurgency: Sandstorm,1,
623,"2019-01-22",0,0,16,0,1,I loved the first Insurgency the gameplay was a beautiful balance between realism and fast paced action. The only drawbacks of that game were the physical limitations of the Source engine and even so it was a work of art.Insurgency Sandstorm has improved on that winning formula in every way possible and thanks to the Unreal engine it has been expanded beyondanything i could have conceived Large scale maps for intense and varied combat mind blowing sound design and plenty of great surprises (not least the additon of vehicular combat) have greatly contributed to the quality of this game and yet it still feels true to the original gritty gameplay that kept me coming back to the original.NWI are great devs they're receptive to community input/feedback and very dedicated in their work (and it shows). I'm very glad I bought this game and would recommend it to anyone who likes shooters from the more casual players to the hardcore milsim junkies.P.S. The only con is the lack of mod support at the moment but that will be remedied and I literally can't wait (so i still play the old Insurgency too).,Insurgency: Sandstorm,1,

627,"2018-12-31",0,0,39,0,1,Very fun game and runs smoothly for me. Tactical combat is very rewarding as well as punishing. Smoke grenades are your best friend in this game. Not enough players appreciate their function and how critical they can be in securing an objective or simply pushing past a sniping turkey shoot. One weird thing I'm experiencing is leveling rewards are not working correctly at least as far as I know. I do not receive rewards for levels I rank up during a match if it doesn't happen on the end match screen. It is hard to describe but you'll play 3 or 4 rounds with apparently exp increases between rounds which you don't see. After the total match is finished you'll see a final experience screen that shows final experience increase. If you don't rank into the next level from this screen you will not receive rewards for the level up. So maybe for the past 10 levels I have received rewards for maybe two of them? Outside of this strange behavior the game is amazing.,Insurgency: Sandstorm,1,

634,"2019-01-12",0,0,96,0,1,In my opinion the game is a step up from Insurgency due to the bots actions are more human like. However the bots accuracy is rediculously on target which is not human like. Sometimes they shoot through walls dense smoke and more. When they come out of a door with their gun pointed down and you get shot when you are already firing your gun something is wrong. It feels like the bots have aimbot. I've worked my way up to level 20 but some games it feels like I am level 1. Open up the acessories you can put on the guns and open up the map. I hate it when you aren't allowed to go here or there. And don't have bots spawn behind my back. Am I allowed to spawn behind their backs? Nooooo. This isn't realism when that happens. I give it an 7.5 out of 10.,Insurgency: Sandstorm,1,
635,"2018-12-31",0,0,23,0,1,I absolutely loved the original Insurgency but didn't care for Day of Infamy the WWII game by the same devs so I was fairly cautious about this new game thinking it might be going in a bad direction. While there are elements I don't like I am enjoying the game quite a bit and fully expect this to become my primary FPS as the community for the original game declines. The Good The core of Insurgency to me is fast paced intense somewhat realistic combat and all that is here. It is a little bit harder to kill enemies than in the original Insurgency but still fairly quick. Soldiers tire quickly sprinting and cough in smoke if you don't have a mask on. Honestly at first I found the sound too intense as all the yelling and screaming from being shot burned or walking through smoke or gas is very uncomfortably realistic (or at least way moreso than other games I've played.) It's so intense I'd almost suggest a content warning specifically for it beyond violence or gore. However it does contribute to the intense atmosphere where it feels like every move matters.There are a good variety of gamemodes although fewer than in the original for PvP there is Skirmish Firefight and Push (my favorite) and for PvE there is Checkpoint. There is also a competitive mode which I haven't explored yet (waiting I'm better at the game). There are plenty of people online for the modes I've tried and a wide range of skill levelsYou can now customize your soldier with choices for voice body and lots and lots of outfits. Honestly only picking the voice and gloves really matters since well it's a first person shooter. The rest is for showing off or looking at while in menu.Two notes about voices you can have a female voice for Security but not for Insurgents. Female screaming may be more uncomfortable for some people (it's more like actual pain than most other games with female characters cough like League of Legends cough). It also can make for a mildly weird dynamic if you have a Security team that is mostly female v. the all male Insurgents. Fire support is adapted from the Day of Infamy model but I think it works okay in this game. The sound alone adds to the atmosphere a ton and it creates another layer of tactical depth. Commanders pick and place them while nearby Observers radio it in. Unfortunately in public matches this level of coordination can prove difficult or unfun if people work poorly together. Right now it feels pretty well balanced. Maps are much bigger than in the original game with mixes of open spaces and close quarters. You can guard streets with your 2x scopes or run around with a shotgun from house to house. Explosives generally are much weaker (i.e. much better balanced) than in the original game for two reasons you can't chuck grenades across the map (not everyone is Tom Brady this time) and there is a lot more spacing you can do. The Bad The optimization. Even on a nice computer it may run poorly although it has signicantly improved from the beta and it will probably continue to improve as the devs keep working on it. Don't be surprised if you find yourself testing out the low settings. The Bottom Line Insurgency Sandstorm is far more than an update for Insurgency. New and larger maps new gameplay elements like fire support and new sounds make this an entirely fresh game. But it still has much of what Insurgency great with fast paced intense fights with some tactical depth. The optimization still needs work but I think the game is headed in the right direction. Even with its imperfections I think it is definitely worth a shot!,Insurgency: Sandstorm,1,

649,"2017-06-06",3,408,17,0,1,"First of all we need to establish what Cold Waters is and more importantly what it is not.Cold Waters is a remake of the 1980's Microprose game Red Storm Rising based on the Tom Clancy novel of the same name. It's a submarine game set in a ""Cold War gone hot"" scenario.It is *not* Dangerous Waters or any of the other Sonalysts submarine sims. Nor is it meant to be. The different crew stations are not represented.Cold Waters places you in the role of the submarine commander *not* the sonar operator *not* the weapons officer nor does it put you working out TMA and firing solutions. The UI is a basic 2D map showing your submarine and other contacts. The contacts shown are based on the best solution available given the sensors in use. If you are just using passive sonar the solution won't be great until you've taken the time to build up a good solution by changing course and letting the AI classify the contact and work out its speed. You can help out the AI by selecting a contact as your active contact (i.e. telling it to focus more on building a solution for that contact) and by manually cycling through the narrowband signatures and selecting the one you think it is. If you're right the solution will firm up faster than if you just let the AI do it. If you're wrong the solution will take longer and be less accurate. If you head up to periscope depth and visually mark a surface contact the classification and firing solution will be pretty much spot on straight away. If you just use your ESM mast you'll get a bearing only solution. You can use your radar mast but the Soviets will pick up your radar transmissions and at a much greater range than you'll get a return. Oh yeah your periscope... has a basic ESM indicator to give you an idea if Vasiliy in the Tu 95 has just picked up your periscope on his radar.Navigating the sub is by WASD to set speed rudder and dive plane angles and you can also adjust the ballast tanks. It's not great but hopefully the developers will add a function to allow the user to set course depth and speed directly (like in Dangerous Waters and Silent Hunter). The current controls are not ideal but they are workable and in my opinion are better when taking evasive action to dodge torpedoes.Weapons are fairly straightforward and very easy to get to grips with if you are a sub sim fan. Torpedoes can be set to active or passive you can set them to run shallow normal or deep you can set the direction of the search pattern and give them a waypoint when to go active. Wire guidance is simulated so you can steer the torpedo or change its depth activate it... as long as the wire is intact. Yes it models wire breakage.Harpoons and TASMs are pretty simple. You can set the waypoint you want them to start searching for a radar target. You can set narrow or wide radar search pattern. You can also set them for a sea skimming or pop up terminal profile. The Soviets will really let rip with their CIWS so don't expect a lone UGM 84 to do much against a Kirov.The sonar model seems to be quite in depth most of the reviewers here criticising it are doing so because they haven't read the manual don't see a waterfall display and think ""Muh arcade game"". Killerfish have modelled sonar performance and environmental effects it's just the AI interprets it all and presents you with its interpretation on the 2D display instead of having the user mark contacts on the broadband waterfall classify them on the narrowband and work out turns per knot etc. Acoustic layers convergence zones surface ducts... it's all there. Killerfish actually said in the game previews they were putting a lot of effort into the sonar/environmental modelling. Lots of people are asking about the towed array. Apparently it *is* modelled but you can't stream or retrieve it manually and you can't actually see it in the 3D graphics.Yes cavitation is modelled and yes you can create a knuckle to spoof a torpedo. You can rig for silent running and this means you can't reload weapons. Torpedoes can jam in the tube if you try to launch them at high speeds rendering the tube unservicable until you return to port.Damage control is of course very simplified. You just tell the repair party what to fix. The manual does say that flooding gets harder to deal with the deeper you are and I've noticed if your submarine is flooding it does effect the bouyancy and you need to blow ballast or use the dive planes to compensate.Playable subs are all the USN SSNs from the Skipjack through to the Los Angeles class. All your favourite old Soviet subs and surface units are there Alfas Deltas Novembers Victors diesels like the Whiskey and Tango the SSGNs like the Charlie and Oscar. Surface units are fairly comprehensive too including Karas Udaloys Moskvas Kirovs etc. Aerial units include Bears and Helix (I think there are Mays too but I haven't seen any yet).The AI seems to take pretty sensible torpedo evasion manoeuvres and uses noisemakers. Once the Soviets have located your sub they pretty much spam torpedoes depth charges and rockets at you so things get pretty interesting.Two campaigns included both are dynamic one set in 1984 and one set in 1967. The campaign map is pretty much straight out of the 1988 game. You ""drive"" your sub around the map where you will see enemy surface and sub surface contacts as they are detected by satellite maritime patrol aircraft or SOSUS (contrary to what another review here says SOSUS is present and modelled in the campaign map). Bear in mind the Soviets also have satellites and maritime patrol aircraft if they detect you then they will vector ASW assets to your location. You can drive around at normal speed which is deep 25 knots. This will mean your sonar performance is degraded you are easier to detect and once you make contact you're likely to be much closer to the enemy. You can drive around at slower speed shallow 10 knots which gives you a better detection range and you will start engagements further from the enemy. This isn't so great when you're chasing down a surface group though. Finally you can sit still on the map shallow at 5 knots have the best detection range and start the engagement at the longest range. Note that there doesn't appear to be any NATO units in the game so you never see friendly units only Soviets and maybe some biologicals. Campaign missions I've had so far are stuff like intercepting Soviet SSKs inserting special forces behind NATO lines inserting SEALs behind Soviet lines intercepting amphibious task groups intercepting diesel or cruise missile submarine wolf packs interdicting submarine replenishment tenders. There will be other Soviet units going about their business on the campaign map and you could very well run into these. The campaign is semi dynamic fail missions and the Soviets win WW3 do well and NATO wins. The campaign is pretty brutal. You will die a lot.As far as technical problems go I've come across a couple. I've had the game freeze on me after I abandoned ship was rescued and assigned to another sub. I've had another campaign mission where I sank a Victor but it didn't ""die"" and was sitting there immobile on the bottom but I couldn't exit the mission because the game still thought there were enemy vessels nearby (I'm pretty sure there wasn't).The developers have said they are considering adding period British and French submarines for the player to control as well. Swiftsure anyone?If you want a ""new"" Dangerous Waters then this is not it. This is not a Sonalysts submarine simulator. If you buy Cold Waters expecting it to be all broadband waterfall displays and TMA calculations then you're going to be disappointed. If you want a submarine *command* simulator set in the Cold War or you remember the fantastic old Microprose classic and want a modern remake that is incredibly faithful to the original then Cold Waters comes highly 1.",Cold Waters,1,
650,"2018-02-19",2,96,32,0,1,"Bottom line A very good sub game with a wrong perspective that makes it feel like a game not as a sim.After playing Silent Hunter 3 for about 600 hours and enjoying every second of it i have been looking for a modern succesor to it. By ""modern"" I dont neccesarily mean with modern subs weapons &amp warfare but as in with modern graphics native wide screen support etc.Silent Hunter 4 i couldnt get into for some reason Silent Hunter 5... We better not go there.Then i got Cold Waters. I liked it right off the bat!Its well made with the right ammount of complexity beautiful graphics a good implementation of mission &amp campaign structure a good representation of modern equippment &amp weapons and a great sense of tactics and warfare its like playing in the movie ""the hunt for red october"".However and here is my main problem with the game I cant get immersed in it. At least not nearly as much as i did in SH3. The single reason for this is the perspective the developers gave us of the game. In SH3 you saw the world from the 1st person perspective of the captain in other words you saw and heard everything the captain aboard the sub would you allways felt like you were aboard that sub commanding it. Yes you could use some external cameras and see your sub enemies explosions torpedoes etc. for eyecandy (provided you enabled them in the realism settings at the cost of realism score) but 95% of the time you saw ""what the captain saw"".On the other hand in Cold Waters you are presented with a 3rd person external perspective. Never do you see what you would if you were the captain aboard that submarine. You allways have an external (and impossible) view of your sub your enemies and weapons. Thats why playing it makes me feel like when im flying my RC quadcopters. Yes im in control of it but im not... ""there"". Add to this is the fact that the external views where you can see your sub the incoming torpedoes sometimes enemies etc. while at 500ft deep sometimes at night are completely unrealistic and realism takes a huge hit. This kills immersion for me. I think KillerFish did a great job with Cold Waters but they also missed a HUGE opportunity. The opportunity to capture all the Silent hunter fans who are craving for a modern version of our beloved game(s). I wish they had chosen to provide us with a different perspective. Every other aspect of what makes a good sub sim is there! the realistically (and beautifuly) implemented vessels and weapons the crews voices the campaign scenarios the tension the sense of dread when avoiding enemies the feel of ""the hunt"" when you are tracking your prey the investigation work to model things as they are in real life its all there. If only i could have a view of my sub interiors my crew my monitor screens the reactions of my crew when under stress what i would actually see if i was there instead of the completely unrealistic and quite frankly useless (except to cheat) external view of my sub. That would make Cold Waters the ""defacto"" place to go for all of us Silent hunter fans.Dont get me wrong as i said before Cold Waters is a great game! and i highly recommend you get it if youre into this genere but thats just it. To me it feels like a game not as a sim. But dont be too concerned about this. if yoube never played the Silent Hunter games youll probably have no problem at all getting immersed in it.EDIT If you do decide to give the game a try (and i advice you do) be sure to do the next things before you start to play 1. Read the operations manual included with the game. In fact read the manual before you buy it will give you a good sense of how it plays. Make sure to go thru the in game tutorials as well.2. Head over to subsim and get the Reduced underwater visibility mod. Seriously its the ocean not a swimming pool. You shouldnt be able to see a torpedo a mile away.3. Look here http //steamcommunity.com/app/541210/discussions/0/1473096694436827913/For a guide on how to set the UI so that all the panels are visible at once otherwise you can only see one at a time (i dont understand why they designed it like this). It will make controlling your sub a LOT easier.Finally If you are finding the game a bit too hard i can recommend these guides https //steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id 974409462https //steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id 956445120And did i mentioned to Read the manual? really its well written and short.

651,"2017-06-08",6,335,62,0,1,"After playing Cold Waters for only 8 hours I thought I'd offer a few quick comments. The graphics are awesome. The game works beautifully. That being said I have to shake my head at a few things.First I was in the Navy during the 80's. I know about Sonar &amp Oceanographic conditions. Unless you're very close a submarine is almost impossible to detect by a surface ship (passively OR actively) if it's under a strong or moderate layer. Not in this game though. Even in the 80's the Los Angeles Class Attack Subs were quiet as tombs. If they didn't want you to know they were there you didn't know.Also while I've always had respect for my Soviet ""Adversaries "" I can assure you that they were never as good in real life as they are in this game. Even at the easy level the Soviets are routinely kicking my butt. And there seems to be no logical reason why I've been detected. It feels like the game just decides to attack you whenever it feels like it. I like simulation games but I like realism too. And a lot about the game just ""feels"" unrealistic.Not sure if I'd recommend but here's some advice. Get good at evading torpedos. You'll need to be. And don't forget Evade in three dimensions. Turn and change depth at the same time. Torpedos have a wide left/right field of view but it's much narrower up and down.Good luck.",Cold Waters,1,
652,"2017-06-22",23,244,68,0,1,"Amazing title that dropped like a depth charge out of nowhere!The balance between hardcore sim and ""Hunt for Red October Simulator"" is PERFECT.A few days ago I had cleared out 6 warships banged up from depth charges and 3 flooded compartents I was limping to the edge of the map to extract no contacts crusing ahead standard at 800 feet. Something didn't quite feel right and I decided to ""clear my baffles"" (submariner term to check behind you since there's essentially a 60 degree blindspot behind you because your motor/propeller makes too much noise).I swing around to find a November class Soviet attack sub 2 000 yards behind me who's been stalking me at low speed to get the perfect shot. Knowing he's spotted he fires a torpedo right at me as my sonar starts pinging loudly at a quickening pace (the faster the ping the closer the torpedo.)Actual sweat forms on my forehead as I quickly devise a firing solution and let a weapon of my own loose in the water. I drop a noisemaker with Shift+D and immediately blow emergency ballast followed by full rise on the planes. I watch as the enemy torpedo misses my rudder by literal inches as I quickly ascend upward. Halfway up at around 400 feet I watch the now rattled November class take my torpedo to his port side and blow up instantly from the pressure changes at his depth.I literally performed a movie worthy Crazy Ivan manuever all of it transpired in less than 20 seconds and the adrenaline was oh so real. All of it was completely dynamic because the AI is outright vicious in this game. On harder difficulties you WILL channel your inner Gene Hackman or you will die in the murky depths below along with your entire crew.(Soviet anti submarine warfare Helos and Bear bombers will hunt you to extinction)This truly is a worthy spiritual successor to MicroProse' Red Storm Rising back in the ancient days of 1988 with a fully dynamic long campaign that reacts and morphs with your performance culminating with either defeat or victory in the bigger picture conflict that you're just a small part of just like in the real Cold (hot in this case) War. The fact that you see land battalions and surveillance aircraft fight it out over a Northern European map that responds to what you've done makes it feel very real. They even have generated news headlines that take into account your success/failure/partial success the day before. Everything matters and the stakes are high as WW3 without nukes is in full swing.The small development team deserves support and are quick to respond to bugs tweaks and suggestions.Multiplayer is coming at some point and I for one cannot wait to sit in silence sonar pinging freshbloods storming through shallow waters at 25 knots just waiting to be picked off.Couple this with upcoming Soviet campaigns and NATO forces modelled in game and you've got a bright future for this title.At first I thought the price was steep but after playing it for 12 hours I can see the effort and detail that went into this game the sound modelling alone is next level and with great graphics immersing you as you skirt below an iceberg off the coast of Greenland to hunt nuclear subs the whole package proves itself to be worth every cent. Finally let's not forget the excellent soundtrack which while only containing a few songs perfectly understands what type of music should accompany modern submarine warfare. It's straight out of Crimson Tide but with its own style. If you have even a passing interest in naval submarine or simulated warfare of any kind you owe it to yourself to pick up this gem. ""Some things in here don't react well to bullets"".",Cold Waters,1,
653,"2017-06-07",0,0,54,0,1,So let get this out of the way immediately. This is not Dangerous Waters Sub Command or Jane s 688(i) Hunter/Killer. This is not a tech sim in sense that each station is meticulously researched and modelled and your job as the player is NOT about staring at the green sonar waterfall display until your eyes bleed. This is a much lower fidelity sim than the above mentioned titles focusing primarily on the command decisions a nuclear submarine captain would face. It is also a loving recreation of sorts of the classic Red Storm Rising which is certainly no bad thing.As such it is doing a marvelous job at keeping me entertained and challenged. The survivability of the boat rests on your shoulders as you advance through the campaign. WWIII has broken out and it is up to you to perform the various tasks command sends down the line to you. Convoys and Soviet subs roam the Atlantic and if you run into them the game takes you into battle mode where you get to test your tactical acumen against a sharp and ruthless AI. The auto crew will handle sonar duty TMA and weapons release while you focus on getting the boat into a firing position undetected. It is also up to you to device an evasion plan because when that torp goes into the water chances are you will be counter detected and attacked. Ruthlessly. Cold Waters is in my book much more adept at supplying that suspension of disbelief that the older and higher fidelity submarine simulators often lack in my opinion. They are great at technically reproducing the inner workings of a nuclear submarine but this a whole different kettle of fish. This is war and you are in command and that feeling is very efficiently conveyed thanks to beautiful design art and graphics. It also forces you to make interesting and risky decisions. Approaching enemy convoys maneuvering into the baffles of two silent diesel subs avoiding detection while dropping off a SEAL team outside Archangelsk all helps to create heaps of tension and suspense. It is a proper submarine experience in every sense of the word.,Cold Waters,1,
654,"2017-06-27",3,199,210,0,1,Purchased this game originally as I played Atlantic Fleet and thought it would be similar. How wrong could I be but in a good way. On the surface seems like a 'plug n play' arcade sim but very quickly you realise it develops into a rather in depth tactical simulator. The game play and actually how to play is not that easy to work out but fortunately there is a very active community on youtube and twitch that provides endless tutorials. In particular Jive Turkey is an ex submariner and his tutorial videos and live streams are both informative and extremely entertaining. Also The Mighty Jingles provides fun insights and between them I believe they have increased the player base massively. I strongly recommend this game as long as you have a bit of patience and like to get involved with the community aswell. There are plenty of mods for the game that it seems the developer looks at and actively takes on board the best ones as part of the game update. Good job all round.,Cold Waters,1,

Also the landing crafts in those hull numbers never exist.最后对中国玩家说几句一些关于把我朝作为假想敌的ZZ评论...首先我们90年代的海军水平确实就是这么尴尬 其次你们没有见过同样被当作假想敌的苏联 俄罗斯 玩家是怎么做的 我去过凉白开的VK社区 人家毛子玩家已经综合出了一个大型mod 不仅完善了本国的舰艇单位 而且做出了一系列镜像战役和独立任务 过场动画全部重新制作 添加了新的背景音乐 游戏中全俄文语音 甚至替换掉了游戏菜单的背景视频 国内贴吧上确实也有人在努力 不过我确实不希望一些ZZ喷子毁了人家的一番苦心",Cold Waters,1,

Realistic environmental modeling.40 ships and subs are meticulously modeled. It has limitless replay value due to the wide variety of encounters. The campaign is dynamic and the map is huge stretching from the North Atlantic to the Barents Sea.The audio is spot on. Wear headphones and you will hear what submarine sonarmen hear.Killerfish is very active in the community and released 2 patches within the first week.Easy moding! Killerfish supports the mod community and has left step by step guides on how to create your own encounters ships and even modify the capability of existing units.

657,"2017-06-09",136,69,109,0,1,The year is 1984. The soviets have created a time machine and stolen sonarbouy technology from the year 2046. Using what little money they had left they trained a crack battalion of ASW pilots capable of instantly finding submarines as soon as they raise their ESM masts or fire a missile. Armed with an seemingly unlimited supply of torpedoes they fly over every ship in the Soviet Navy.Now you as the solo suriving NATO ship must stop the Soviet menace before it is too late! Work with...um command... as you single handly destroy the entire Soviet Navy that should've spent less money on time machines and more money on training Captains to evade torpedoes. Go weapons free and fire at every contact you detect immediately to blast your way throught the campaign because your captain's sixth sense knew it was going to be a bad guy anyway.

663,"2018-05-11",3,214,0,1,1,It's good but this literally uses Verdun's files and shouldn't even be a seperate game. The playerbase on this is dead so please go buy Vurdun instead so at least we have more players.I hate the idea of not really knowing if I killed a bot or player since there is very little players. Verdun has full games and is more satisfying to play.Please combine the two and not split the playerbase.,Tannenberg,1,

665,"2018-03-16",1,37,14,1,1,I loved Verdun when it first came out and as someone who played that game from its days as a free downloaded demo I can say this game performs just as well if not better. That being said it would be unfair not to point out that Tannenburg and Verdun are two very different experiences.Yes they both have the same mechanics majority bolt action rifles one shot kills capture and defend based gameplay. However the way both games are structured is integral to the overall experience and this is based entirely on the setting of each game. Verdun was a tense exercise in authentic trench warfare where you could die at any time either from artillery a machine gun fire or a lucky shot from across no man's land. Advancing was a brutal slog across open killing fields facing lines of players armed with scoped rifles and placeable heavy machine guns. Run and gun shooting was brutally punished while slow paced tactical cooperative play was rewarded.Tannenburg takes this formula and chucks much of it out the window. Gone are the linear avenues of advance across no man's land now maps are much more open and divided into individal sectors that can be captured at will rather than being forced to wait upon an attack and defend timer. The more open maps coupled with the addition of sectors now rewards fast paced run and gun style battles as you race from sector to sector capturing strategic points and snubbing hastily organized enemy counterattacks.Returning Verdun players will probably be disappointed by the removal of some features. The ingame arsenal has been dramatically reduced no longer can you carry around machine guns automatic rifles and the more exotic weapons like the flamethrower and shotgun. The current arsenal includes only bolt actions with some semi auto pistols and revolvers and the ever popular melee weapons. Officer call ins have also been dramatically reduced in power no more triple gas clouds or creeping artillery barrages on demand unfortunately. Both of these are offset however by the addition of emplaced HMGs at key points on the map that can be manned by either side and artillery posts in key sectors that can be used to call in heavy bombardments anywhere on the map.The lack of current squads on the roster (4 to Verdun's 12) is also a downer but most people forget Verdun only started with 4 squads as well and the others will be relased overtime. We can probably expect such additions as the bulgarians Romanians and additional K.u.K Russian and German squads later down the line.All in all I still love Tannenburg. Its the same mechanics done in a differnet formula. Everything you loved about Verdun is still there with a few new things to love as well. The dev's are listening to people's feedback (unlike some) and the game gets tweaked and additions are made on a fairly regular basis. If you loved Verdun I highly suggest you support this project as well and help this addtion to the World War series become just as great!,Tannenberg,1,
666,"2018-10-28",3,77,42,1,1,"Everyone is complaining of lack of real players in their reviews but it's not that bad. On average you'll have maybe 5 v 5 with a TON of bots that add for ""bulk "" and help bring the aspect of the incredible numbers seen on the Eastern front of WWI. It's fun engaging and it is realistic. It's a great game and it will be even better later on. If you're wanting something like Verdun with nothing but players then play Verdun. I think the devs are doing a great job and are keeping to the great scale that WWI brings to the table. Tannenberg is a much better and more realistic WWI shooter than Battlefield 1 and it blows COD out of the water.

669,"2018-12-04",4,202,267,0,1,"Hello everyone! It's been a while since I've written a review and I decided to make my ""comeback"" so to say with one that is well worth writing about. So as per usual I will preface this by saying that this game has been a huge undertaking for me and I never expected it to take me this long to finish it. I also took a small break from it (towards the end of the last chapter around a month ago) so I can wait for the 1.1 patch that would fix most of the bugs after the point of no return.So a little backstory as to how I stumbled upon this game. I have been a fan of CRPG's for two decades but I never played any table top games so I wasn't aware of the Pathfinder universe..until I have read a thread about new Kickstarters coming up and that Chris Avellone was going to be involved in some way in creating Pathfinder Kingmaker. This drew me in immediately (Planescape Torment being my 1# of all time) and I went ahead and backed it. And now here we are...after 260+ hours with a game that I now consider one of the best CRPG's of all time that has managed to rival Baldur's Gate 2 &amp Throne of Bhaal in many aspects and surpass it in others. This game is a complete CRPG package. And I will tell you why below Pro Compelling story with choice &amp consequences (in a game a decision you make in chapter 1 will affect the end game) Replayability via hundreds of classes and combinations (multiclassing) Extreme levels of customizability in terms of difficulty (that appeals to both veteran players and new) Variety of companions with interesting backstories that are worth pursuing Multiple endings and slides depicting your effect upon places you have visited Kingdom Management is meaningful and important to the overall outcome of the ending Music is good where it counts (combat ambiance and during some dialogue scenes)Cons Some graphical/interface bugs Performance/technical issues A LOT of loading screens Needs better tutorials to explain all the mechanics (especially the kingdom related ones) Majority of artisan quests are still buggedKeep in mind I finished this game on patch 1.12 which solved the majority of game breaking bugs. YMMV but post patch 1.1 I haven't encountered a bug that has stopped my story progress. Many of said bugs have been fixed already.I cannot stress enough how big of an undertaking this game is (both for the person playing it and having to invest over 100 hours and for the Owlcat devs to patch the bugs) but if you learn to love it despite some bugs and some flaws and issues that will be eventually be patched then you are in for one of the best CRPG's ever in my opinion.I hope more people give it a chance and recognize it's greatness even though it is a daunting task.Do I recommend this game? YES! The value of this game is through the roof. The pricetag alone brings you at LEAST 100 150 hours of content.If you've reached the end of this review I thank you and apologize for being so lengthy (I wrote it minutes after finishing the game).",Pathfinder: Kingmaker,1,
670,"2019-01-21",8,199,163,0,1,I'll just start with two quick TL DR observations 1) This game is on the borderline. This would be a negative review if the reviews were mostly positive. It has a lot of self inflicted flaws.2) If you're wondering if this is the game you were waiting for it is. It's that game. You know who you are. If you've been casting about in this age of nostalgia and remakes for that hard edged Infinity Engine treatment based on tabletop rules but have been dissatisfied with the major releases you should know this is the one you were waiting for.Most of the people who dislike this game at its core will tell you what you might like about it in one way or another if you read what they have to say with a grain of salt. The game is not for them but it may be for you. However there are also people who dislike how the game shoots itself in the foot. They have a point unfortunately. (I'm not counting the bug reviews. Those were perfectly justified. I started playing late and the bugs seem to be gone.)The problems aside from the release bugs boil down into two categories in my view 1) Difficulty of systems combined with lack of documenation. The game cannot really be played without constantly Alt+Tabbing and asking the internet. I am not primarily talking about PF/d20 systems here. Whether it's avoiding game ending quest failure the lack of characters who can fill the very necessary roles for your barony absurd early game encounters that do nothing but confuse and discourage new players or simply knowing where you should go next it's just not possible to play the game and see what happens. Playing this game without meeting it 3/4ths of the way is how you end up with the negative frustrated reviews here. Half of this game is played in a browser looking at spoilers and I really can't say whether the browser or the client gets the bigger half.2) Quality of Life issues. Why is it not possible in a game that encourages you to spend hours and hours dealing with character sheets for you to save or export characters? Why in a game that has 60 ish subclasses and 8 races before DLC are custom characters gated behind an outrageously expensive gold fee transparently designed to ruin the fun of people who don't care about the written NPCs? If Owlcat is so proud of the okay ish writing for these NPCs why is there no option to give us a limited respec of their starting class or stats so we might actually want them? Why do my ranged characters always charge into melee BEFORE drawing their sword provoking an AOO instead of doing it in the sensible order? Why is there no viewable feat tree? Why can't I change character voices if the voice test is going to be broken? Why are *any* of the cosmetic features locked on creation?With all that said it is definitely the bones of the game I've long wanted. It's the game where you cast Web and Fireball off the edge of the screen to soften up (or win!) a difficult encounter. It's the game where you can go crazy with buffs and CC or summon help that's as powerful as you are but where your enemies can do the same thing. It's the game where RNG makes everything a bit more real making you pay attention all the way through every fight. It's the game that attempts (with limited but greater success than you probably expect from a small studio) to make tasty little alignment choices constantly that aren't just pushing A or B and having BioWare tell you how awesome you are but at the same time don't feel like a test or a puzzle. It's the game that encourages min/maxing and a desire to learn a system instead of just rewarding whatever notion the player has. In short it's a Baldur's Gate update that looks and feels like a 2018 game. A real one not simply an impostor in screenshots both for better and for worse. This shouldn't be too hard of a choice for anyone. The positive and negative reviews both have the information you need (the bugs are gone now).EDIT You probably should not even attempt to play this game with a hard disk drive. The loading times are just long enough to be annoying with an SSD. With an HDD you would *really* be getting the 1998 experience and not in a good way.,Pathfinder: Kingmaker,1,
671,"2018-12-01",8,357,105,0,0,Disclaimer This review is based off me playing the game in November 2018. I am certain the game will improve with time as it is developed. This review is verbose. I have been playing RPGs for thirty years. There s bound to be some salt.Well it s done. I finally completed the campaign after 100 hours. I m physically and emotionally exhausted. I m going to break each component of this game down and then at the bottom give final thoughts. Pathfinder Rules Implementation 6/10 You ll see many classes/archetypes represented in this game. There s magic too much of the bread and butter from tabletop are here. Skills are greatly condensed. Entire branches of magic will be crippled and missing due to the combat myopic viewpoint of this campaign. Clever RPGs move non combat magic into the environment directly that is sadly missing here. It s a poor substitution for real role playing. Liberties are taken with PFRPG core mechanics in the name of making a video game. It s inevitable in adaptations from tabletop to video game but the details are not trivial. It s a subtle but crucial element that gives games like Baldur s Gate or Neverwinter Nights the longevity they still enjoy today. Kingmaker was designed a single player experience from the start but I wish they had given us a single player campaign coupled with a multiplayer capable engine.Environmental Design 8/10 This game s environment stands head and shoulders above all other parts. It is immersive and vibrant and I love it. It s so good in fact I feel work here may have taken resources away from other areas of the game to the point they suffered for it. The artwork is first rate in many areas of the game. The Stolen Lands are necessarily ambiguous and open to interpretation of creative people. The lavish plant environments the bits of fog mist or rain make for setting the tone of exploring vast wilderness. I spent many hours excited about filling in every map eagerly waiting to see what s over that next ridge. This captures the essence of this Adventure Path better than any other aspect of the game. I wanted to see more. I wanted to do more. Sound and Music Design 6/10 I flipped back and forth on this more than any other part of my review. The sounds music and voices that are present make the world come alive particularly the music for non combat areas. However Some songs will haunt you in your dreams because of how often you visit. Example given The kingdom theme music when in your capital city. It s a nice melody that loops and loops and loops. It will be with you at work in the car at the grocery store etc. There needed to be at LEAST three version of town music that would rotate at a slow pace It s okay to let the town go quiet for a few minutes before firing up that same effect or song for the 30th time in five minutes. If there had been more variety I would have given this an 8/10.Encounter Design 3/10 Frustrating and sad the majority of combat in this game involves insanely over tuned stat blocks. Minor enemies like kobolds can murder a low level party due to ability scores rivaling player characters and armor classes higher than your frontline fighters. You will die. Often. Even on easy. The people behind these encounters assume every player is min maxing their entire party. If you don t just uninstall the game now. It isn t a complaint about difficulty it s about the blatant in your face cheating. You will see creatures cast incredibly powerful magic over and over with no limitations. You will run into the kind of cheese design where once you finish the second to last creature in the encounter another half dozen more enemies literally pop out of the ground.Kingdom Management 2/10 In the creation of this game somehow this system got wedged in. You just have a stat sheet and a deck of cards. Every event is a problem or opportunity. Management is done day to day so you never know when it s a good time to improve. Advisor slots are rare and slow to unlock. I never solve all the problems before the next one broke out. This spoils the entire open concept of Kingmaker forcing you to address only proscribed problems or else. Or else what you ask? Or else you get a Game Over screen. In my case I had multiple problems arising with only one person to solve them. In the end all these problems come down to one glaring issue balance. It s unfinished and in dire need of mods or patches to improve the system. Bugs 4/10 The Bugs are mainly simple glitches missing components and broken quests. Some major plot points are so broken that you autofail. Because of these issues I found myself at the endgame with my main party reduced to three characters. The crashes the client freezes the exploits are all too numerous to mention. I wanted to really immerse myself but the bugs kept kicking me out. I had bugs so bad that I had to literally install Cheat Engine (a first for me) so I could circumvent entire nonfunctional bits of game. We re in December the game launched at the end of September.Completeness 4/10 The first 20 hours of gameplay are polished to a shine. There s deeply scripted events the thrill of risk/reward and joy of good gameplay. You get invested into the game and then the honeymoon ends. You get your kingdom and this game practically falls to pieces. All the wonderful role playing character investments decisions all that just goes away. You re going to have to fight to survive. There s no exception because no developer ever got time to script any other option into the game. So sharpen your axes gang because the only way out is through.Development/Support 7/10 There s a lot to praise here. The patches for this game have been rolling out regularly. The patch notes are long. The fixes and features are good. The company responds to many complaints and posts and seems to be genuinely engaged with their community. I like that because it shows a willingness to provide customer service and a genuine desire to improve their product. If this game had released December 1 2018 I am certain my review would have been better. But the patches for certain things came too late my choices were try and limp through my battered and broken campaign or throw away 100 hours of work and tears and finish feebly if not triumphantly.Final Thoughts 5/10 As it stands now I cannot recommend this game at the $40 price point. There s too much still in progress or broken or bad. Even as a hardcore Pathfinder 1st Edition fan I can t say it was worth my time or money. Maybe in six more months of hot fixes and updates this game will be worth $40. I will probably do a second play through next year. Until then I recommend you check out some Let s Play gameplay and save your money. I m sure the wait will be worth it eventually.,Pathfinder: Kingmaker,1,
672,"2018-09-26",15,1007,19,0,1,"In A Nutshell Pros + Exceptional variety of classes available boosting replay ability by a lot.+ Very deep and complex combat mechanics.+ The Pathfinder setting is one of the best Fantasy ones around.+ Excellent voice acting in dialogues and narration.+ Very well written and varied story role playing interactions.+ Quality graphics for a CRPG.+ Great variety of enemies loot weapons equip and spells. Cons Time limit on Main Quest and also on certain critical Events later on. Very annoying. Fatigue / Resting mechanics as of now are annoying and make exploration less enjoyable. Way too many random fights while traveling. Problems with enemy balance in several fights making them too much RNG dependent or frustrating. Cannot create a custom party from the start mainly for money reasons. This can lead to unbalanced composition.Pathfinder Kingmaker (PK from now) is a classic RPG set in the universe of Pathfinder one of the most famous and iconic ones of all time. The game starts out impressively well boasting a huge amount of character classes to choose from and suit all the play styles and roleplaying needs each with its own skill trees and sub classes even assuring an incredible variety. The character building system is the classic deep old school CRPG one using attributes and lots of statistics and based on d20 rule set with a few modifications here and there.The impossibility to create a custom party from the start typical of many old school RPGs such as Baldur's Gate or Icewind Dale to mention a few is a bit disappointing and also can lead to party composition problems later on as depending on choices different ""mandatory"" companions with preset classes will be added to your party which can in turn become unbalanced in a negative manner. A custom party is doable but only later.PK adds to the classic CRPG formula some management gameplay first you will have to take care of the fatigue needs of your party manage money well to afford camping supplies potions and healers and be efficient in your travel paths while later you will eventually be able to manage your very own little kingdom with most of the aspects deriving from such responsibility. In part all this is new and welcome but on the other hand such mechanics are several times made in ways that make them more annoying than anything else.Pathfinder Kingmaker is a deep and wide CRPG title with some excellent points to it as you can read above but also several issues regarding game design and balancing which weigh pretty heavily on the overall experience resulting ultimately in a far less enjoyable gameplay than it should. In depth Feature Analysis Gameplay The gameplay of PK is based mainly on Exploration Combat Role playing and Management.Exploration is performed via a global map featuring pre determined roads to follow and many crossroads to decide directions. Even if the path is not free but ""on rails"" the game still features a good amount of locations and places to discover around the world. There is no fast travel traveling takes a long time and your party can encounter enemies and random events while doing so and also need rest pretty often. Fatigue builds up the more you travel depending on constitution of each character but sooner or later rest is needed or major penalties to attributes occur making combat and checks a lot harder.Role playing interactions as in any CRPG should be the crown jewel of the experience and in fact they are in PK which features very well written dialogues a vast array of options some of which unique and tied to the player's specific class alignment or other factors and deeply branching dialogue trees. On this side this title is excellent and will be the joy of any role player.Management part is about rationing resources wisely using resting supplies sparingly being efficient in traveling around and later managing resources and other aspects of your very own kingdom including repelling invasions and hiring advisors. The fact invasions are also timed and your presence is needed to repel them in a certain time will be rather annoying as if you are in the middle of something you'll have to go back. Story The storyline featured in PK is long and complex as relations between noble houses and kingdoms come into play often as do intrigues and struggles for power. Not only but your alignment and relationship with companions can even change the outcome of many events making the possibilities all the more interesting! Writing is great albeit some typos here and there and companions / characters are interesting and have great personalities. Combat System Combat is real time with dynamic pause a classic for CRPGs. Since it uses a d20 rule set as core expect an uncompromising deep and complex battle system worthy of the classics of old where a lot of factors need to be considered and where each fight is a tactical challenge on its own. The only problem with it is balance as you will soon see. Content &amp Pricing As expected from any CRPG the game is very long on its own depending on how much you explore and quests you take and difficulty aswell the game can last even 80+ hours. For the proposed price of 40 i'd say the game is worth buying for the amount of content offered alone. Balance &amp Challenge There are serious issues here. Several encounters on the Challenging and above difficulties are incredibly punishing and unfair making the player rely more on lucky strikes of RNG rather than strategy. This would be okay if happened seldom but instead happens quite often. The mechanics about Fatigue Camping and Resting are unnecessarily annoying and result in the exploration becoming a chore instead of interesting as it should be. These are by FAR the worst issues of the whole game. Technical Analysis Graphics Very good for this genre using Unity3D engine and achieving surprising results. effects textures and models are of good quality while portraits and art are superb. Excellent. Sound Good soundtracks excellent voice acting and average effects. Solid. Performance &amp Stability Performance needs some optimization work at the moment but with some setting tweaking most issues can be solved. Decent. GTX1080 i7 4820K 16GB RAM Artificial Intelligence Enemy AI is pretty smart and will focus one character to quickly kill them sometimes and use advanced tactics such as flanking and pincer maneuvers. Companion AI is not that smart sadly and sometimes your peers will just do nothing and have to be manually commanded most of the time. Quality of Life No issues to report. Bugs &amp Issues There are quite a few minor bugs around but nothing major to report. Many people did report save game corruption and crashes but this never happened to me. Conclusion Kingmaker is a very good CRPG in many aspects but those few downsides are quite critical because of how they impact the overall experience and really hold it back from being a truly great title.

673,"2019-01-19",5,415,154,0,0,"Kingmaker has the potential to be one of the greatest CRPGs ever made. The scope is incredible the ambition behind the game is commendable and it's clearly aiming to be a true spiritual successor to the Baldur's Gate series. Unfortunately the game was released several months too early. Its myriad issues have been documented in angry postings across the internet suffice to say that the game simply cannot be played above the lowest difficulty level without the use of a guide and regularly save scumming. There are many many ways for players to inadvertently fail quests (often before they've even begun) or find themselves in unwinnable situations which they couldn't possibly have prepared for in advance without cheating. The ""Kingdom Management"" mode is very obviously still in an early beta state.

BugsI followed the advice of many players and waited a bit until i started my playthrough i also fooled around with chapter 1 and 2 for some time to get a feeling for the combat system and the difficulty settings. Also i tried different approaches to the kingdom management until i was certain enough i understood most of it but even after that i encountered many bugs small ones like character animations medium bugs like some broken dialog but also gamebreaking bugs like invincible enemys sending you into a combat loop with no exit option. The dev team tries their best to solve the bugs and up to chapter 4 you should be relatively save from the worst of it now but you never know.2. BalanceI would not recommend you try the harder difficulty settings since you wont go from one important battle to the next where you just have to figure out the right tactics. You fight much ""trash"" that can and will obliterate you if you do not take it serious. Exploration wont be funny and rewarding if you have to use everything in your arsenal every battle and you wont be able to rest easily to reset your spells and heal.Beginning with chapter 5 or 6 you will notice that balance is thrown out of the window i dont think that this part of the game was tested at all you will meet enemys with armor ratings 35 and bosses with armor 50+ which means that only the most specialized warrior type characters will hit them until your characters crit in the last 2 chapters it gets totally unfair since you not only will meet said enemys but wont be able to buff yourself because of the location your are in. 3. Kingdom ManagementThe kingdom management is one of the best features of the game but its that badly implemented i would recommed you to set it to auto or at least to ""invincible kingdom"" nothing you do there really matters and if you make mistakes you might see the game over very quick. IF you want to try it always save bevor managing something and reload if the outcome isnt to your liking even small decisions (who does what when) can have dire consequences (what if there is no one to do something?) i wont spoil it much more but maybe one thing dont even try to understand the overall happiness system when and why your kingdom goes to ""worried"" or worse is as unclear as it gets.4. Time ManagementYou will always be on a timer some are shown in your quest log some are not. You can guess by some kingdom events that you are on a timer but it wont be completely clear until you fail. There will always be the ""brawl on the hill"" as i would call it (you know what i mean when you see it wont spoil) and it will be on a visual timer but thats just a window it wont happen exactly when the timer is up but somewhat earlier so even when you know the timer you cant be certain.If you play with active kingdom management you will have to manage events they dont spawn once a month or on a special day they can spawn anywhere within the month (most spawn at the start and at the end of the month but you never know) so if you go out exploring and you are out too long you might have a problem once you return. This leads to you going out for a few days completing as much as possible of the map and then rushing back to at least your kingdom area if not your capital to manage events forget about chilled exploration. This also leads to save scumming since even top notch management will lead to very difficult events later on (DC35+) which you barely win even if you are deeply invested (yes you will use your own gold or you wont have enough resources to get far) in your kingdom.A little suggestion/hint do main story quests asap and rush it as fast as possible! That way time management gets a little bit easier.5. StoryThe story has its ups and downs but is mostly satisfying until a bug destroys it for you or you reach the last chapters where things go wild. One hint dont miss your companion storys they are good and very important later on if they dont bug out (for me they themself didnt but the consequences did my decisions lead to one of my companions dying in its story but it turned up again without any explanation and did something very frustrating to another companion wont spoil more since im not certain its not a bug)Personal Remark For me the game ended like it went in a bug i wasnt able to enjoy any epilog even had to adjust difficulty to story mode just to make it that far and that felt very embarrasing my whole gameplay experience felt like a beta test. I will now watch the ending on youtube and thats a shame to put it lightly.I myself wont touch the game for the next few months and i dont recommed anyone to do so.Took me 2hrs to write hope it helps some of you.",Pathfinder: Kingmaker,1,
675,"2019-01-22",4,125,101,0,0,"The game starts off strong character customization (in the form of builds not models) is almost as though you're choosing things right out of the Player's Handbook in a tabletop game. Soundtrack is stellar voice acting is good (mostly) art is lovely it checks all the boxes for a good Pathfinder game for those familiar with the universe in terms of gods settings classes you name it. But as much as I enjoyed the first hours of the game in hindsight it ain't worth 40 clams. Here's why First the bugs. Now I've put this game down and picked it back up over several months of attempted patches and bug fixes. Every time I return to the game I still find quests that cannot be completed. I still have issues with pathfinding on maps I still find inaccessible areas or treasures glitched items or impossible objectives. This is far from a finished product. This is a year or more of development beta testing and more out from 2019 at the time of this review. I'm pretty forgiving when it comes to bugs in truth and there were times I found the game utterly unplayable for its glitches and hiccups. But even as forgiving of this issue as I am it pales in comparison to my next.Take a look at my hours played. I would earnestly wager a quarter of that 100+ hours is loading screen. They're many and they ain't quick. The game artificially lengthens itself in a number of ways from instancing between the smallest of buildings or caves for a good minute or two to not including a teleport spell in a game with an overorld map to forcing you to retread ground constantly . Worst offender is the Throne Room to Overworld. I can't count the number of times I had to leave the Throne Room cross through my entire town and finally get back onto the Overworld Map. Why not give us a shortcut hmm? And not only this but certain problems demand either replaying for positive RNG results or reloading in an attempt to remedy some impossible task or unexplained mechanic. This goes for both the Kingdom building aspect and the adventuring half of the game both demand constant 'rerolling' in effect and lengthen the game time artificially with laughable solutions. Stuff like this leads into my next point.The time wasting isn't even my biggest complaint. The difficulty is. An avid player of the PnP version of the game for years now and an experienced DM there's junk in this game that will make you pull your hair out. I'm not against challenge but there are creatures abilities and spells that will be spammed at you that make the game tedious frustrating infuriating and hopeless. No DM in their right mind would throw swarms at a level 1 character. No DM would throw hordes of CR 19 enemies at level 15 characters. No DM in their right mind would make encounters this oppressively impossible unless they were just the biggest and cruelest in the community. ""Going into the lava area? Hope you prepared for ice enemies ya rube! Oh anticipating spell casting enemies in the magic tower? Nah man it's all barbarians that trip you and eff you up to the top. Faced wolves in the past did ya? These are super wolves son. They got cones of cold and junk."" You know nobody at that table is a friend of the DM but they soldier on in some self flagellating exercise for the simple fact that they've got nothing else no DMs no games no nothing but this to satiate their Pathfinder/DnD craving. And that's just sad bro.I've invested 100+ hours trying to see the story through and I've given up. I've given up at the final boss after suffering through defeats for hours on end with no possibility to remedy my situation by attempting to level buy new gear etc. For lovers of Golarion or Pathfinder or just DnD in general don't take the chance. You can find a game it's more accessible than ever. Go to you local game shop. And if you don't like people pick up Baldur's Gate or something. Do not make the mistake I did do not pick this game up. It will just net you gray hairs in the end.",Pathfinder: Kingmaker,1,
676,"2018-09-30",4,88,205,0,0,"This is going to echo many of the reviews on here but here goes.The problems with this game can be summed up with one simple line. Bad GMing The Video Game.To be more precise the dev's took a fairly faithful recreation of both Pathfinder and the Kingmaker module then filled it with absolute nonsense monsters that have no resemblence to the monster versions actually found in pathfinder. This skews game ballance and makes for a frustrating experience in combat that goes like this.Save... very important.Buff up all the spells.Attack Give it everything with your casters hold your cleric back to heal.Miss alot.Party wipe.Reload.Repeat until RNGesus changes ""Miss alot."" for Enough hits to kill what your fighting.Rest.Move onto next oponent.Now that's a slight exageration but not by much. In the opening ""Stag Lord"" chapter there are so many fights like this because of what the developers have done to the opponents in the game. In the P&amp P game a challenge equal to the party level should take about 20% of your resources however the opponents are so overtuned that they are not equal challenges. Let's have a quick list of a few things that cropped up so far on the playthrough I am on.Random encounter with bandits... where there were 6 of them some with caster class levels. ACs in the 20s for some of the fighters really high attack bonuses and archers piling in pain from the hill to the right. This was at LVL2 when I still was on 4 characters and no cleric because of the way that the starting characters are divvied up.The swarms... well there's enough on these in other reviews. These are missing key things like taking more damage from AoE attacks are going to be in combat so become harder to hit even with flasks nobody will have precise shot by this point unless you cheat for money to make your own party or take it yourself.How about caves filled with permenant DEX STR attack mobs. Yep... those aren't a cascade of failure if your not willing to save/reload constantly.How about 1 bad check and you have to fight the stag lord and all of the adds at the same time. These guys are pumped up bandits too. They will wipe the floor with you consistently... reload an earlier save.How about the spider that attacked me in my sleep at level 5 so no spells because I'd just had to burn out on another combat that was AC 27 + a flat 20% miss chance. My best striker had a 16% chance to hit... The others were having to roll 18+ to get a hit... the spider... no probllem rolling through AC 25 (Val's AC at that point).Owlbears with dragon stats. Bandits with ACs like they are wearing magical everything and dropping non magical scale. Carniverous plants that are positioned at zone entry and can kill your casters in one swing.The monster setup is like that GM you played with as a kid for about 2 sessions who just wanted to kill your characters.The thing that finally made me write the review is going through an area called ""Swamp Witches Hut"". Now... I've already had a few ""burn it all or die"" fights here that took a couple of re loads but now I've just jumped into a secret area and I see a ""Greater Enraged Owlbear"". Now an Owlbear is a CR 4 challenge in pathfinder. My party would wipe the floor with one of them... but there are 3 of them... and they are ""Greater Enraged"".I had faced two ""Owlbear"" monsters in the game already. These were pumped up well beyond what an owlbear is in the P&amp P game so I started thinking... have the designers pulled the same rubbish with these. Oh yeah they had.The previous owlbears were more Lesser Dragons without magic. These were just straight up dragons in Owlbear costumes hanging out in the woods. Here's some stats taken from the combat log.Base Attack Bonus + 18... EIGHTEEN. A mature red adult dragon is base attack 19.Strength bonus +14... that means this owlbear in game terms is STR 38 39. For comparison a Tarrasque a legendary CR 25 monster is STR 41 in the P&amp P game.It uses power attack at 5. Now looking at power attack from the feat it's 1 to hit and +2 damage for every 4 character levels. Yep... that's a level 20 owlbear.For giggles it also has weapon focus with it's claws because it needed more attack bonus.Finally it does 2D6+24 damage (2D6 + 14 str +10 power attack)... which it will do every time as my best AC in the party is 27 and it's hitting that on anything but a 1 (because 1 fumble).So it will hit every attack dealing an average of 31 damage.On the other side of the board it's got +16 natural armour over 3 times more than a regular owlbear turning my team's attacks into an average of 25% chance to hit.I repeat for the true madness... there are 3 of these. This is an area your going to hit at level 5 to 7 and these ""Dragons come owlbears"" are going to rip you to shreds. The issue is that these are not isolated occurences as there's another area across other side of the map which is similar.That's the kind of unballanced mess your dealing with. It's also the point where I realised that YOUR characters are playing Pathfinder they have all the relevant classes stats feats and rules from the game but the GM is not playing the same game as you. If I'm constantly wondering about every oppoenent in the game trying to work out what crap the designer/GM has pulled with this one it very quickly becomes a chore rather than a game.Those owlbears are the point where I stopped playing left the window open so I could double check the stats as I wrote then closed it down until I see a patch that sorts the balance out.At the moment I really regret that I bought this and have put as much time into it as I have. This coming from someone who lists Jagged Alliance 2 Baldur's Gate 1&amp 2 Icewind Dale 1&amp 2 Fallout 1&amp 2 as my favourite games of all time. This has surpassed PoE 2 Deadfire as the worst CRPG I've played in some time and it didn't need to be.This could be a great game but messing with the established material in a way that looks amaturish and with no sense of balance has ruined it.

677,"2018-10-31",17,186,223,0,1,After over two hundred... Yes that is correct 200 hours of bugs glitches and loading screens I beat the game on challenging difficulty (which is the core rules I believe it was incredibly hard) and I can finally stop playing and forget it for awhile.Isn't this game just massive? or is the super annoying kingdom managment that 'manages' to stall you for ages? I believe that between loading screens and kingdom managements I must have wasted over 50 hours of gameplay...But here is the thing which is the most messed up one by far because of the bugs...This game is the true spiritual sucessor to Baldur's Gate 2 its not Divinity OS...its not Pillars of Eternity... its not Tyranny not Tides of numenera or any of these new wave of CRPGS that you can name of...Its this beautiful steaming pile of glitches and hair pulling loadings of a game I never got bored of it for a second. The complex mechanics made me finish the game wanting to start another gameplay just like we all did many many times with BG2 I wanna test a solo run a trio run a bunch of different builds and alignments min/max a bunch of stuff talk to people about the game invent op stuff by myself and so on... But if I did that right now I would consider myself a masochist...I bought RDR2 on day one and I preferred facing all of the bugs in this game first before playing itI can't downvote Pathfinder Kingmaker aside from the obvious massive issues its all I ever hoped for a CRPG faithful to the PnP and unforgiving...

680,"2018-11-09",25,731,367,0,1,"If you ever get bored of the end game grind here's a small list of things to do that may make you feel a little happy.1. Try a new weapon. I can't stress this enough! Don't just stick with one weapon try to learn them all. You'll definitely find something that fits you best but knowing another weapon makes you want to do hunts again and again. You will get a lot more hours doing this.2. Play with friends or with randoms. While in most games playing with randoms can hinder your gaming experience but that's with all multiplayer games. There are bad apples but in a coop game they're not nearly as problematic. When playing with people you can and will have moments that will highten your experience. Like in Level 6 Kulve Taroth jumping down and breaking her gold coating on the horns with just one hit while your teammates drop rocks on her tail while also ruining her precious golden mantle. You can seriously get a good sense of comradery when playing with people. As for friends do the same thing but also take on hunts that challenge you. If you find a monster annoying keep fighting him. Learn his quirks. This game is as much a learning game as it is a fun game. Learn weapons learn monsters. 3. Go on an expedition and just watch the monsters. Throw on a ghillie mantle to cover your tracks for the more fierce monsters but explore and capture small creatures you find. This game has fantastic monster behaviours. In the Rotten Vale I suddenly found myself next to an Odogaron and I prepared to fight him after he roared but soon he continued walking away. Following him from a distance I then found him going about his daily routine which was scavenging for food to bring back to his den. Every monster has their own quirks out of combat. They're not soulless creatures which makes the experience even more fun knowing that they are closer to animals than virtual creatures created for slaying. 4. The obvious ""do all the quests."" Optional quests other quests. Every quest. Blue completed optional quests do not count you must make them orange! Do this and reach HR100 so that you can simulate the final episode of Neon Genesis Evangelion and just be congratulated by everyone. 5. Finally make your own builds use whatever weapons you want. Every weapon is viable in this game. If you like the look of a weapon use it. It doesn't matter make it yours. You can use meta weapons and meta builds and while it may be fun for a while it may get dull. Do something unique take chances with your builds and find something that suits you. Vitality decorations mat be useless for someone's build but it may save the life of a build built around fast regeneration and maximum immortality. That's about it. I'm writing this late at night so excuse typos. Maybe those things to do will help you out a bit. Maybe it'll squeeze out a few more hours or maybe it'll conjure a few hundred.

I was skeptical when I first bought it. I asked myself ""Is this any different from Dauntless ?"" and within the first 2 hours of playing I realized it's nowhere compared to Dauntless.Of course it's not fair compare a free to play game with another game by a very established developer Capcom. But I thought it would just have the core of what monster hunting should be.I stand corrected. Monster Hunter has surprised me with the other aspects besides hunting and the mechanics of hunting. This is truly a one of a kind unique game. About 200 hours clocked in as I'm writing this review yet I'm still not done with this game. Capcom is constantly pushing out new events and new monsters. They listen to the community on how the game can be improved and they have proved themselves to be developers who care for their players. I'm only comfortable with 1 out the 14 types of weapon in the game and I am planning to try the other weapons.

686,"2018-12-23",15,292,257,0,1,Monster Hunter World is GOTY of 2018 for me. Here are my personal opinions on the positives and the negatives of this game.Pros + Extremely engaging hunts+ 14 different base weapons with tons of different variations for each from the monsters. The weapons have such satisfying impact.+ The environments feel atmospheric and it feels smooth to navigate through the jungles and all the other locales.+ Unique artstyle+ Frequent updates with festivals collaborations (Megaman Devil May Cry Final Fantasy Witcher etc) and new monsters added Behemoth being the last new monster to be added before the eventual Iceborne expansion.Extremely hard versions of the already implemented monsters in the form of Arch Tempered monsters are added for the duration of events each offering a more powerful armor set. Also Layered armor sets.+ Max 4 Player Co op coop is very well implemented save for the very janky experience if you're trying to play co op during story missions. There are strange limitations before a friend can join for example you have to see all the cutscenes. But most of monster hunter happens outside of story and that's where it shines. Its just a pleasure to play with others.+ Complex character build opportunities you can mix different sets to get your optimal build and you can insert jewels into slots in the armors that give you additional skills.+ The progression feels so fulfilling even through the 100h mark you wont feel bored.+ You have crafting systems before a hunt you have to eat a meal to grant you different buffs for your next hunt you can farm ingredients you can meld decorations (the jewels) and you can sent your Palicoes for an adventure to bring you loot.+ Hunts have such fun hijinks monsters disturbing your encounters with another monster they have turf wars and overall hunts turn into a pleasant chaos.+ The Switchaxe+ Great community overall people put effort into their guild cards and most people are helpful during hunts. No real toxicity. + You really shouldn't have to mention this but yeah no microtransactions. Probably why the game feels so good in this day and age.+Ultrawide support's here! Took a while but they did it.Cons A mediocre story. Annoying handler seems to take all the glory for the hunts even though never participating actually in any. A liability. Performance has been optimized imo but still I dip occasionally below the 40fps and one of the recent patches kinda botched the performance. SOS hunts tend to be a bit infuriating because some players just are potatoes. So carts happen a bit too much at times. I'm not sure but I think the game has a desire sensor. Curse it! Bazelgeuse keeps popping up in all the wrong times. (Edit ) Co op does suffer from a few hitches early on in the game when you're doing story missions with friends. You first have to enter the quest alone and see all the cutscenes before your friends can join in which is just frustrating.If this game appears in a sale or even at it's full price this game is an absolute recommend!,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD,1,

695,"2018-08-22",0,0,188,0,1,One of the first games I purchased at full price in a while and I gotta say it was so worth it. The only previous Monster Hunter experience I've had was a demo of one of the games on the PSP so bear with me. Whether you're hunting big monsters solo or multiplayer with friends or random people this game is a complete blast. I started off with the weeb slash Longsword but now I'm a Lance main and haven't looked back. My personal favourite monsters to fight so far have been Odogaron Nergigante and Kirin.I run this game on a pretty low end laptop and aside from a certain Elder Dragon fight I can run the game at a stable 30FPS which obviously isn't optimal but I'm pretty content with it although obviously I've had to take some liberties with the resolution and graphical settings VFor anyone with a higher end laptop or desktop (most people) like most other people have mentioned you should turn off volumetric lighting for a huge FPS boost. I haven't had too many connection issues when playing with friends so it's been a fairly minor annoyance for me although I can understand everyone's frustration with the session disconnection issues and being unable to see some of your friend's sessions when trying to connect. I'd be pretty annoyed at Capcom for these issues but at least according to what I've heard from people I know Valve has had a pretty big part to play in these issues due to them suddenly rolling out their new friend list and chat systems and apprently doing so without informing anyone. I'm not saying the info is 100% true or accurate but with the whole friend list spam issue and the game being defaulted to run in Big Picture mode I've been kinda inclined to agree. BUT! as of tonight they've rolled out an update that should have hopefully fixed most if not some of these issues.Anyways...Pros Fun combat with many different monsters from fairly easy to fight monsters to more challenging monsters that require more knowledge about your weapon of choice game mechanics and obviously the monster's moveset. Fun solo or with friends. Some weapons are better than others but there are no trash weapons there's something for everyone with some weapons having a much higher learning curve. Tons of cool different weapons and armour to craft all with different effects. Gem slots in equipment to further customize your combat abilities. More monsters gear and special events (including crossovers) coming soon as free content updates. Some are already on PS4 and even more are arriving with time. More content beyond the main story. Personally grinding for gear is fun. You can change some of your character's features after the initial character creation.Cons A bunch of multiplayer issues with varying frequencies of occurence. (Disconnecting for a session mid quest sometimes not being able to see friends sessions not being able to join a friend's quest). Having to watch in quest cutscenes before friends can join your story quest. Bug where friends and SOS players cannot join your quest after you finished watching all of the cutscenes required in an story quest requiring you to restart the quest to do so. You can change SOME of your character's features after the initial character creation. It might feel repetitive for some people especially later on and grinding for gear may become less fun. The research base was kind of sort of a cool secondary place but it's not really an important area other than to start certain quests so it serves more as a minor annoyance to have to travel to than anything. You can pet Poogie but not your Palico?! No wonder Palico seems to like the Handler more CHopefully the patch really did solve most of the connection issues though V,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD,1,

As soon as there is a problem They will rebound over and over with negativity. The game as a whole is phenominal. Truly one of the greatest MH games I have played. Yes there are connectivity issues. I know it was released with connectivity issues. I have fell victim to the issues. Does Capcom know about it? Obviously. They are working to fix it hence the latest patch released on the 22nd of August. I mean 5 days between communicating that they know about the problem to having a patch ready to roll out is impressive. In an office its hard to realise the extent of a network issue. People should be glad it released months prior to Capcoms estimate predicted back in January/February. Consider it early access even! So the 41% review it is currently sitting at is BS. It's worth at least double. People need to grow up. It wouldn't be sitting at 10 million units sold if it was a bad game.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD,1,

715,"2018-08-22",1,2,80,0,1,Reading a lot of the negative reviews I thought I would throw in a review of my own. Now I played on console (Xbox to be exact) and love the game but due to not paying for Xbox Gold I couldn't play with others. On top of that my friends owned Playstations so I couldn't play with my friends which just gave me more reason to repurchase the game. For the most part the game is the same exact game that the console launch had.I'm seeing a lot of people complaining about no DLCs such as Deviljho and Behemoth but it was announced a month or two before release that they would be released on a later date. I feel like people hating on this game for that reason should've just read the news closer/more. The dev team said that due to their lack of knowledge in working with PC releases they would not be releasing any DLCs on time.I also see a lot of people complaining about optimization issues. I'm using an Intel I5 Processor and an Nvidia 1060 and have 0 problems running this game 60 FPS. The only time I ever had issues was in Full Screen and alt + tabing out of the game with a controller plugged in I found it would consistently crash my game. This was easily fixed by switching to Borderless Windowed.The network issues has already been addressed by the dev team and they are currently working on a fix though as they said they do NOT have experience making games for PC so it may take time. I also did some expirementing and found out a couple things about the issues. If you're playing with friends and someone leaves the session for any reason the game thinks the session has ended and nobody else can join the session meaning if you aren't already in the session you cannot join. I've also noticed an issue with a friend's computer (who has very much higher specs than me) in having issues with Steam connection sort of. It will consistently boot him offline then online again but doesn't create any issues in game besides not being able to host. My recommendation is find a suitable host out of your friends and then don't leave the game if you plan on coming back soon. Users should also note that the console launch had these launch bugs with network issues as well.The only other issue I've really noticed is the game will randomly hit me even though I'm blocking on gunlance. This is rather rare and random but it does happen and really isn't an issue.I do highly recommend this game but please keep in mind that you do need a mid tier computer at least to run a smooth 60 FPS. This game has launch bugs like every game has but is definitely worth the $60 asking price. If you were looking to play the DLC monsters right away I would recommend either buying the game and prepping yourself for those fights or waiting to purchase the game until after those DLCs are released.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD,1,

717,"2018-09-09",1,2,1194,0,1,Previously had 350+ hours in the Xbox version alone. Still learning new things on the PC port today. Decent content and more to be added. Very high grinding potential due to RNG. Plot and character development on the weak end of the spectrum but being backed up by the wonderful soundtrack and style of music its really not bad. Being under the impression that the action the monster hunting is where this game really shines. No committed RPG roles you get to pick your playstyle from the item and weapon loadouts you choose and if it's not working out you can switch things up on the fly. Skill and patience may be required. Find or make friends to play with to tackle the more difficult quests or to have a little more fun. The community is very supportive and you can find plenty or guides and advice online. Overall great boss fight simulator. I recommend.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD,1,

725,"2018-08-10",0,0,72,0,1,Review to follow at a later date.EDIT First things first. Yeah controllers are not recognized by default yet. Yes it is kind of annoying but easily fixed by enabling the steam controller API. You can even disable big picture mode launching whenever steam detects a controller for good measure. There are also a handful of multiplayer connectivity issues and I can only imagine that they will be ironed out in the near future this being release weekend and whatnot. The majority of the negative reviews for this game are because a) someone took one of the above points very personally b) there is not a certain graphical setting that they want or c) they just don't like MH games or this particular style of combat. To entirely write off a game as massive as this within your first two or so hours of playing for any of those reasons seems foolish to me. A fully detailed review of my thoughts on this game so far would be too long for anyone to justify reading so I will just leave my whole hearted recommendation here for anyone who cares to read it. I am having the time of my life with this game as I have with every MH game I've gotten my hands on since discovering the series back in high school.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD,1,
726,"2018-12-31",0,0,180,0,1,Do you ever dream of taking down a 40 foot iguana and running from a fire spitting tyrannosaurus rex on the first day at your new job? Well if so have I got a game for you!The good * Feel like a god swinging impossibly large weapons like they were foam cosplay props to take down colossal monsters. * This game has beautiful visuals and the action translates well to both keyboard and gamepad control schemes (uncommon for a console game series coming to PC). * This game has both sides of the social preference covered you like playing with people perfect! you're going to want to use the S.O.S. system at every opportunity. If you don't want to be social you can also play solo as much as you want and if you reach a point where you cannot progress on your own communication is almost nil between strangers so you can think of them as AI if you prefer. * For PC gamers unfamiliar with the series this is the perfect entry point as far as gameplay goes. It is a far more gradual learning curve but there is still plenty to take in if you want to master the game. * Costume weapon and monster design are fantasticly done.* Regular events and specials keep the end game content fresh.* edit apparently modding exists for this game! This is a huge plusThe bad * If you REALLY like the social aspect this game isn't really for the chatty folks. Missions are on a time limit and that Anjanath isn't going to just roll over and let you rip away at its belly while you chat about the latest Game of Thrones episode. * The system requirements are steeper than average and not everyone can run it well.* Some call the game a grindfest you can argue any game dependent on item RNG is a grind. * The game does not generally (there are a few exceptions) use a transmogrification system. There are some amazing armor sets that just don't have the stats to be worthwhile to wear. Adding this feature would be a huge boon Capcom. (edit there appear to be client side mods to allow tranmogs!)Not my opinion but something I've heard from others the limited time content isn't frequent enough or the events continue for too long and the game can feel stale. I think this all depends on how you play. If you just want to power through the content to get the best gear you're going to have more trouble than most with this aspect of the game. If you just enjoy playing with others and mastering each of the weapons on the way so you can use the best suited weapon for each mission then you're in for hundreds of hours of gameplay. Even the friends I've heard from that said the game got repetitive at the end had put in well over 100 hours each.Summary it's a terrific entry into this great franchise and even modest estimates would rate it at under $1 per hour played at full price. You will definitely know in the first hour if this game is for you or not.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD,1,
727,"2018-08-24",0,0,474,0,1,"First note Ignore any ""review"" complaining about connectivity they are outdated and are no longer relevant. tl dr Game is amazing from both graphics sounds and gameplay grinding is reduced unskippable cutscenes and mp connection issues are fixed.As my first Monster Hunter Game I've had the games on my radar for awhile but never wanted to play a console version now that it's on PC and is ported overall well.I found the game overall easy but challenging (varies by person). You could find yourself getting destroyed by a tough monster the first time then giving it the beat down in the next encounter now that you actively know how to avoid most of its attacks. I don't trust online rando's though they'll usually come in and die 3 times because they're just bad and ruin your hunt because you only have 2 spare team lives (normally) the 3rd death fails it for everybody.The game is extremely streamlined from previous titles to the point that people will say that it is too casual. You have a customizable shortcut wheel for items you need to use quickly the maps are one big zone instead of individually loaded areas and it's simple to track down and you have access to materials all over the map and crafting on the go as well as your entire item box at each camp to restock even to swap equipment and items mid hunt.The normal formula is pretty much accepting a quest eating food for health and stamina buffs spawning at a camp in this decently sized map beginning the hunt for your target creature by finding its tracks or coming across it picking up materials on the way which is basic gathering mechanics finally finding the creature and engaging it.The battles don't take place entirely in the area you find it it'll move to new sections occasionally as you beat down its health and it tries to run. Other monsters might butt in and either attack you or another creature sometimes they engage in a Turf War and one will win and deal massive damage to the other. Once you have successfully hunted your creature by either killing it or capturing it you have 60 or 20 seconds respectively to collect additional materials around the map or carve the killed creature for crafting parts.There are no rpg levels or stats in this game everything is based on your equipment. Sometimes early on can be tough since you're lacking in armor and damage but it just gets easier from there just make sure your items are upgraded.There are a plethora of weapons weapon upgrade trees and armors each with their own specialties for you to craft from the monster parts you collect. You don't see too much at first but it eases you into it as you progress through the story missions.The game has beautiful crisp 1080p graphics and the sound design is phonomenal they did an amazing job making the game feel not like maps and bosses but pieces of a whole world and the creatures that inhabit it. You'll find capturable wildlife strewn around killable herbivores that graze around and potentially attack you you'll see the monsters roam around and occasionally interact with things in the world even getting caught in vines and sinkholes during a fight. The environment can be as much as a tool as your inventory.Cutscenes are unskippable which will annoy some the handler (the girl who is with you throughout the journey) is one of those annoying audio tip characters who doesn't do much but remind you how to block or dodge when you've already finished the game.Multiplayer is slightly hindered by the fact that you cannot join your friend until they've watched a story mission's cutscene which is usually when they find the monster. And if you're progressing together you both have to go separately get the cutscene invidivually then one abandons to join the other.Imo it's best enjoyed if you don't rush the story and occasionally do some side stuff inbetween assignment missions.Overall it's something of a 9/10 game that I haven't been able to stop playing for 2 weeks (so far).",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD,1,

729,"2018-08-10",0,0,132,0,1,"I have played Monster Hunter since 2013 with 350 hours in MH4U and 60 hours in MHG and MHW for me is a really big mixed bag. There is one BIG Minus that literally almost made me not recommend this game but if you have enough patience to get through the big minus then you should definately get this game.POSITIVES+The co op (When it works) is friggin amazing the gameplay of MHW is the best I have ever seen especially ranged weapons now. Capcom learned from Dragons Dohma with the feel of the bow and mounting and it feels amazing.+Watching monsters fight each other in the wild is the greatest thing I have ever seen the trailer doesn't give justice to the ""oh quot moment when you see a monster pick up another monster and slam him into the ground.NEGATIVES (The BIG minus) As someone who primarily plays Monster Hunter games for the multiplayer co op I have to ask Capcom why do you have to try and meld the singleplayer and multiplayer campaign together? There would be no trouble if you were able to play story missions together from the beginning but you have to launch and then quit after you've finished the cutscene just to relaunch the mission if you want to play with friends. &lt sidenote&gt Capcom should be able to at least know how to put multiple people in the cutscene or instead just show the one player in the cutscene when you're in the party together. Capcom should know this because they literally have monster intro cutscenes in previous games like MH4U granted it isn't as cinematic as MHW but they could have at least done something like that just so it could stop the frustration with the players. The relaunching wouldn't be a problem because you can join one of your friends in the middle of the battle if you want but there is one big problem with the connections itself. I don't know if it is just me but me and my friends literally a few states away sometimes cannot even join each other's session or even mid join the mission. Most of the time whenever we try to midjoin the mission after the friend watched the cutscene a pop up shows up saying it failed to join the quest. I know MH is usually peer to peer but it has never been this bad and I hope Capcom fixes this issue. Expeditions they're just gathering quests but it is so hard to go on a multiplayer expedition.I still haven't made it past HR 8 so these are my earliest impressions and my biggest problems and I do hope that Capcom fixes the servers if there is anything to fix otherwise I hope there's something we can do to make the connection better for most people.",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD,1,

734,"2018-08-12",0,0,21,0,0,"I overall think this game is okay.This review is nowhere near as long as some of the other reviews I have made but I just wanted to get a couple points clear This game is an annoying console port. Some settings turned off make the game look better and give you significantly more fps. The controls are so annoying and the inability to turn mouse smoothing off is forcing me to use a controller to play this game.I would like to address that the movement is wonky. For example heavy weapon classes are irritating to get used to because the aiming to hit your target is bound to your WASD/Left Thumbstick where as most games it's bound to the camera (mouse/right thumbstick). Because of this annoying feature I am stuck using lighter classes like dual blades.Why can't I watch and play through cutscenes before monster battles with my party? Having to play through the same cutscene quit the quest join your friends pray that the connection gets established and spend 60 minutes just to kill a monster individually because your friends lag out half way through the battle?The tutorial in this game is HORRIBLE. I didn't learn much and the annoying cutscenes weren't skippable but the dialogue with actually semi useful information is??? Instead of building this story that doesn't even matter and in fact is one of the worst game stories I have ever experienced! I understand that this isn't an American game I understand that it's supposed to be reminiscent of the PS2/PSP experience but c'mon! The damn lip syncing and voice acting is so god damn bad to the point where I have to skip every single piece of dialogue.No wonder this game is getting so many bad reviews but PS4 people love it! It's a totally different target audience of gamers. Dumb game mechanics controls graphics story and movement all ruin this game's beautiful sense of visual combat ""levolution"" of terrain if you will and the amount of classes and class trees etc.I want to love this game but don't expect a patch for at least 2 months because we are talking about CapCom here...",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD,1,
735,"2018-08-12",0,0,212,0,1,"I'm new to Monster Hunter MHW is the first one I've played. It definitely has problems which I've encountered in my short play time but I genuinely believe it is a good game so far if you can look past those problems.So far I've seen...Pros Online pros Online play is very fun when it works (see cons about that). Four hunters hammering a boss is quite a sight to see! I think it's very cool to be able to help randoms easily while benefitting yourself with rewards. The SOS Flare is also a cool idea like requesting emergency response.Design pros I really like how you can learn more about your targets through experience (what they are weak to etc). It amazes me that there are 14 weapon archetypes all with fleshed out movesets tricks and features! I've been really enjoying the Bow ever since I sorted out my controls. (see cons about that) The crafting system has a lot of depth and I really like the weapon upgrade system. Armor upgrading seems pretty generic but different pieces having different traits is very cool! The world is quite varied in which animals live where where to gather certain supplies and terrain features you can take advantage of. I've only had to resort to the wiki twice to find where something is found (Earth Crystals and Wingdrake Hides). It's usually pretty easy to find where things come from and you eventually gain the ability to cultivate certain resources. Your pet Palico and Poogie are FRIGGIN ADORABLE! Like oh my gosh it's a little piglet in pyjamas!!! AND YOU CAN PICK HIM UP!!!! I feel like personalization fashion and character creation are pretty solid. The story is not ultra compelling but I like how the protagonist is portrayed as heroic and cunning in them. It's a subtle thing but too many games these days portray the protagonist unlike they are.Gameplay pros Combat is quite intense. I haven't died many times but I hear it only gets harder as you progress. Reminds me a lot of Dark Souls and Dragon's Dogma. Combat mechanics have quite a lot of depth to them enemies have weak points weaknesses resistances and players have several tools at their disposal to take advantage of these.Cons Meta cons I know $60 USD is not an uncommon asking price for games these days but I've seen several people turned away for it being too steep a cost. While I've not encountered serious performance issues I've seen several others complaining (justifiably) that the game has been running sluggishOnline cons For an MMO the online experience has been patchy for me... I guess the servers are having trouble keeping up right now which may explain disconnects... but I absolutely hate how difficult it is to play with friends who are at the same stage as you in the game. (See below) Want to progress through the story with your friend? Sorry this problem has been solved ever since co op has existed but we'll need one of you to watch the quest's cinematic before being allowed to join your friend. Want to join your friend on an expedition? Sorry you can't just go in with them they need to use an SOS flare first. Want to see your friend in the main hub area? Sorry that's clearly impossible to implement go use the Gathering Hub instead.Design cons I really don't mind it but dialogue is weird in this game. They've obviously hired voice actors for every voice but they've done a lacklustre job at giving every dialogue voice lines. Some are fully voiced some are partially voiced and some are just Navi the Handler going ""hey!"". I'm a quiet individual who prefers to use in game chat when possible in games. This game's chatbox however is TERRIBLE. You get 40 characters per message make them count. Gameplay cons Controls are VERY weird as is the case with most ports of Japanese games. I don't know why you'd think they could have someone tell them ""Oh hey what if you don't use V to aim ranged weapons?"" Avoid Target Lock at all costs... It's terrible! Combat has been way better for me without it. Tutorial coverage seems a bit odd to me. While they do a great job at explaining what they do explain it feels like they trigger at odd times. For instance I held off on taking any monster capturing quests because I didn't know how to capture monsters yet. Turns out the game gives you the tutorial after loading into a capture quest. Who would've thought!I know that looks like a lot more negatives than positives but I still believe the positives outweigh the negatives. Several negatives are correctable and so while it's shameful they are there in the first place they haven't prevented me from enjoying the game.",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD,1,
736,"2018-08-12",0,0,355,0,1,It's a solid pc port of an amazing game with a few major caveats. The two big elephants in the room on this ons is the game uses aditional DRM with it incorporating of Denovo and it's also quite rather demanding on your GPU and CPU so pushing anything better then 1080p on medium can be a challenge even on relatively new gaming rigs. Basically you need a GPU around the ballpark of a 1050 ti or 960 (officially you can get by with a 760 on potato quality settings but I wouldn't recomment it) and you don't want anything less then a 4th gen i5 for the CPU.In addition to all of this this port launched with a quite a few annoying multiplayer issues that will hopefully get resolved ASAP.Ultrawide monitor users were also out of luck on launch since no 21x9 as of right now.The PC version doesn't have all the additional console content unlocked yet but it will be added in time.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD,1,

738,"2018-08-09",0,0,43,0,1,Optimization is kind of crap right now but the game itself is bretty gud. No 21 9 support but if you have a 21 9 monitor you should be used to that. I'd recommend waiting for word of an optimization patch or a sale before buying unless you've got some pretty beefy hardware especially on the CPU side(note This is just a personal observation from performance numbers I've seen but the game seems to favor raw core count over throughput per core so solid quad core systems may lag behind CPUs they otherwise wouldn't.)EDIT A version of Special K(which some of you may remember being an essential mod for NieR Automata) has been made for Monster Hunter World. This adds some useful improvements including a CPU spoofing feature which will force the game to use the correct number of job threads rather than the 32 it seems to be trying to run by default on every CPU. While this will not completely fix the game's optimization it is a notable improvement and worth downloading for anyone who already has the game. If you don't have it my previous recommendation still stands.You can find the mod in question here https //steamcommunity.com/app/582010/discussions/3/1745594817439431537/,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD,1,

Being led around losing control of camera angles bordom.Got into the first mission/fight. What crappy controls. Maybe I'll get used to it or I'll have to see about doing some remapping. I'm going to keep playing I'm going to keep going because I have some friends that bought it too. One of the few games that we were all looking forward to playing. But realistically as of right now I don't recommend playing this. Hopefully I'll change my review later. Hopefully. /UPDATEOk so I've played it some more. Controls are an issue still. I switched to controller and it seems to work better. BUT I shouldn't have had to switch. It's annoying. Multiplayer is fun when you can do it. I too have experienced the errors/crashes that I read about on other reviews. And the fact that everyone has to be ""caught up"" to play certain missions together when some of us bought the game to specifically play with friends is just crap.Look the game overall is fun but has too many problems for a game of this price.

On the other hand of the spectrum my friend has issues with basic computer functionality. However both of us have had no performance issues at all hunting monsters through the forest at a relatively stable framerate with none of the surprise game killing drops that everyone's been warning of.Likewise the controls that everyone has been so vehemently against have been a non issue with the both of us adapting and getting better at our usual speed.Don't believe all the complaining this game is a fine game and a beautiful addition to your steam library even with everyone whining in the background.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD,1,

Check.Great Map Design? Check.Awesome Fighting Mechanics? Check.Endless Content? Check.Massive Variations in playstyle possible? Check.Sick Fighting animations and special effects? Check....Honestly i'll cut this list short because i'll stay busy until tomorrow morning.All the fuzz about port issues? They're t. I play with a 4 year old PC with a GTX 980 I could play on Max settings on 1440p and I get really smooth FPS. (I'm really fussy about fps drops and all that stuff.) Occassionally I get a framedrop when there are a thousand explosions happening at the same time but honestly every PCs framerate would tank with that.There are a few problems with connectivity and stuff. It happens occassionally that you get a connection error and need to restart your game. Honestly that's not such a big deal because this game loads up pretty quickly and it auto saves all the time for you.At first I was a bit sceptical about this game I originally didn't plan on buying it but damn that would've been a big mistake. Then I planned on not grinding too much because I thought it would be boring but this game just keeps sucking you in and the grinds don't feel like a drag at all. (All I want is to get that last damn armour piece to complete this set!)So to wrap this up Do you like amazing fighting mechanics great graphics and endless content wrapped together in a challenging yet fun setting?

764,"2018-10-02",0,0,271,0,1,If anything this game is one of the most satisfying game I've ever completed. Story 8/10 I've &lt strong&gt never&lt /strong&gt played any MH series before and by looking how big the MH franchise is I thought it's more on the gameplay and neglect on the plot of the game. The game proof me wrong the plot of the game was laid out nicely even in a fast pace manner it creates such a sense of accomplishment in each quest and at the end game.Soundtracks 9/10The soundtracks make every parts of the game even better from the beginning 'til the end of the game. From how it build up tension or rewarding players from completing quest or the game itself they nailed it. I know for some player especially the fans of MH franchise some soundtracks are kinda disappointing &lt spoiler&gt (I must admit the Elder's Recess theme is pretty boring but then again the theme was meant show some serious tone after all it's close to end game)&lt /spoiler&gt but then again overall the whole soundtracks manage to live up the game.Gameplay 10/10You know that an action game is great if you can feel the weight of every hit you do and that's what MH gameplay all about. Having to fought a bigass monster with a bigass sword and to actually manage to land a heavy hit is so satisfying. Then again there are 14 category of weapons you can use from a greatsword dual blade bow gun even a bloody trumpet each have their own playstyle and their own satisfactory. Really tho you might feel great from bashing a T rex head with a bloody big hammer but have you ever thought how great it is to spinning and flying around monster using a dual blade or a glaive like those Recon Corps from Attack on Titan?If you are new to MH series you might found the game is pretty hard to adapt to the game items skills buff and the interfaces (it's a lot alright no easy way to learn it) but once you make do with all of it it will show how all the trouble to learn it all pay off by how a great hunter you be DMultiplayer 7/10It have been patched and actually functioning now. Some people might said that the multiplayer is still whack because you can't progress the main story at the same point with your friends (you can still hunt together through main quest tho) but personally I found the main story much more enjoyable to be played solo.Graphic and Design 8/10Maybe it's because how little areas they have in game the level design in this game is astonishing each area is beautifully made make you want to take stop at some point from all the hunting and appreciate the surrounding of the area. Tho despite how beautiful the level design is for some certain reason they did not make the option to turn off the motion blur. And last but not least the interface. It is might be confusing but after you manage to get around of it it actually pretty simple.Overall rating as a standalone game not comparison to the other MH series I give it 8.5/10.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD,1,
765,"2018-09-07",0,0,186,0,1,Most of the negativity in the reviews for this game have to do with launch day connection issues. At the time they were justified and appropriate. Capcom has slowly been working on fixing the problem and I can't speak for others but the issue has completely been resolved for me. The game is fantastic and you're in for hundreds of hours of content here.Wanted to give the game a good review since even if the issues are fixed not all of the initial negative reviewers will come back and update their reviews accordingly. At least this will help balance that out a bit.

772,"2018-08-19",0,0,336,0,1,Good game the ammount of hours you can put into this game justify's its price point. Highly recommend to playthrough using a controller for ease of use and because the mouse acceleration and input delay can make it feel very unpolished compared to what most are used too on PC.A lot of the salty complaints about paid cosmetics likely haven't got into high rank to start earning layered armours. I fully welcome more paid cosmetics anyway and hope we get some options to set the game apart from consoles.I have experienced some connection issues but not as many as people have been making it out to be you do not need a team to complete any of the quests or monsters in the game regardless of rank and its typically easier on your own anyway.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD,1,
773,"2018-08-21",1,2,112,0,0,While World does have much needed QoL improvements when compared to the old MH games the package is still lackluster. The story can get really boring with unnecessarily long cutscenes and uninteresting dialogue it's a downright chore on repeat as well. Get to a new zone find tracks follow scoutfly fight monster then repeat ad nauseum.The areas are also a cluster in terms of both layout and looks. The scout fly mechanic is a crutch made to both think for the player and to mask the convoluted and poorly designed areas. While the game is impressive looking technically the design constantly clashes with itself because the textures either look great or downright terrible. The core gameplay in MHW is very fun and addicting I put at least 80 hours into it and idled for a lot more but the whole package is far from amazing. If the terrible connection issues are fixed it'd still about a 7.5/10 experience. Decent game terrible port.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD,1,

We used to take pride on having the best platform to run our games and having the knowhow to keep it that way. To be fair Monster Hunter World far less friendly or appealing to 'casual' players but at this point it's gone far beyond personal taste. Anyone who can't take more than five minutes to learn a mechanic in a game shouldn't be reviewing PC games.Now players can't even be bothered to figure out how to use a multiplayer lobby or even read a guide before they write negative reviews and drive titles into the ground because they don't provide the child grade accessibility and instant gratification of games like PUBG or CSGO. In such cases these games are designed with accessibility in mind to make it easier for you (and children) to spend real money on their loot crates and other microtransactions.If you are reading this review and you are a competent PC gamer you have almost nothing to fear from this port of Monster Hunter World. If you can rollback your drivers are within 1 spec and know how to optimize your graphics options beyond ""low medium high"" you can easily dial in a smooth experience. The server issues have been almost completely resolved with no more disconnects during missions. With proper setup I've managed 40 60 fps on high settings with my modest GTX 970/i5 rig at 1440p.

Are you guys insane?! xDThis might be (or IS at least for me) the best entry in the MH Franchise so far! I just love every bit that i encountered in my nearly 50h by now!Short Pro/Cons after the Edit. Then a lil text about my experience of the game / how it feels. Edit + i never had a crash or problem not even a lag so far. I'm putting this here bc a lot of people wrote me asking about performance its just flawless. Cant say anything else i even tried streaming (to other people and between pcs etc) no problem.+ Controller support is great! PS4 or Xbox One both work (plus keyboard and mouse ofc) though the button icons will be set to either keyboard+mouse or Xbox controller. Controls are the same / same bindings as across the series so if you played MH before you'll be right at home )I play with PS4 now mostly bc its way more comfortable than cheap ol' Xbox (even tho its an original one *cough* just poor quality microsoft *cough* &lt .&lt ) and i didnt have any problem.i'm at about 50h now so far i can say....Pros + familiar MH feeling+ a lot of (minor?) improvements in HUDs and Menues and Gameplay wich smooth out all the lil hickups the older games had making a really solid and good base+ hunting and stealth aspects make the game much more interesting so does the manuvering in the maps / open worlds+ really beginner friendly tutorials are really well made and easy to understand even the paching is great by handling you things over not to fast but also not to slow.+ Learning Curve is both good for experianced and beginner players this time+ uped the grafics (like MH tri)+ new poin system mixes it all together and you have rewards for every lil thing you do wich feels just great!+ the lore is actually exsistent this time and is presented in a good to understand and interesting way+ as is the story. and i mean a real story it has one this time. Maybe a bit light but its there and its good!+ optional quests not only improve items chefs kitchen/eating weapons etc but aou now can also build camps and make it easier to travel and play on a map if you prepare and buold stuff up! You ahve to travel there before and find places where you CAn tho wich is cool in my book bc its immersive but might annoy people. just look up a guide then.+ the grind actually got better like in you can get quests wich higher drop chance better ) Its not too easy but also not too hard wich i apprichiate having build Rathian set for what feels like the 100th time xD+ DLC / Patches are free as always ! i love you MH devs !Cons since so much had to be changed / fixed and of so many improvements (grafics better story and tied in monsters open world animations and movement quality) it does not have as man monster as other titles. You dont relly feel it tho its not that much less then it might look on the paper. Its like with Tri / MH3U kinda judging but what i saw myself and heared i would say you still got about 300h of content so dont worry ! DLC from console does not seem to be implemented yet (?) but i guess its okayIt feels like other monster hunter titles but also it seems to be more than that. It seems to be what i and my friends always saw in MH. You really can feel like a Hunter tracking monsters doing research building up camps and taming the land as you want IF you want. Or you can just slay monsters and help out others just jump an and have some team action on hard monsters (they get harder with more players ofc but its also way more fun and the teamplay is not counting rare hiccups really great).Also solo is aboutsultely possible and fun! I actually swap between the two when ever i feel like it no prob. Go in do your thing if thats what you like. If you have trouble you can still decide to call fo help anytime tho ! Just great how fluent it works )Like i said might be the best Entry yet but i still have a lot to see so i will stop here PIf you still are not sure and you HAVe played MH just buy it you dont be disappointed i swear!If you dont know the frachise but are interessted you should bring lot of time. Like i said 300h gameplay probably and thats just when you do all monsters you can grind quiete a bit on the way.

Everything about the online for this game is either counter intuitive or just out right broken. The lack of squads forcing you to us a friend code system from the youngest days of the Nintendo DS is also infuriating. Instead they went out of their way to remove that feature and instead run it off of steam groups which does literally nothing other than put a picture next to your name. And that's not even getting into the unskipable cutscenes and being forced to watch said cutscenes to even play the missions with friends. For a series that grew and thrived on a great multiplayer experience this game tries its best to go against that. For everything the actual gameplay and graphics does right the actual interface takes two steps back.

783,"2018-10-20",0,0,290,0,1,https //alsgamingstuff.blogspot.com/2018/08/monster hunter world pc review.htmlMonster Hunter World isn't called Monster Hunter 5 but it's totally Monster Hunter 5. It's also kind of a reboot for the series. MHW feels like a game that takes into account the things most people ask themselves when they first play MH such as Why is the map an item taking space in my bag? and Why is the quest rewards window on a timer? . MHW gets rid of a lot of the stupid stuff that has carried over from game to game for no good reason besides it being how it has always been done. A lot of things have changed but at its core this is still very much the same style of game.For the uninitiated Monster Hunter is a game about hunting monsters of course. But seriously Monster Hunter is a game about boss fights and loot. It s about learning bosses attack patterns preparing for fights and reaping the rewards when you beat the bosses. Bosses don t drop weapons and pieces of armor like in Diablo or WoW though. You get monster parts from carving their corpses and then you craft your gear from those parts. This might sound gruesome but there is very little gore in the game. The game has a light hearted comedic style to it and is no more violent than something like Zelda. There is a story tying everything together but it is not much more than an excuse to lead you into new areas and introduce new monsters to kill.Compared to Monster Hunter Generations Monster Hunter World controls much more fluidly but if you re looking for a Monster Hunter game that controls as smoothly as Devil May Cry you ll be sorely disappointed. This is still that kind of clunky complex animation priority heavy Monster Hunter. There have been a few key improvements that make the game feel much better to play though. The biggest ones being the weapon sheathing and item using systems. You automatically sheathe your weapon when you start running now so you can get away from a monster more quickly. You also don t have to stop running to use an item anymore so you don t have to stand there and go through a long drinking animation and risk getting hit again. These might sound like small things but they re huge improvements and make the game play much better.The biggest change to the game is in the hunting itself though. In previous games you had to carry paintballs around run around an area to find the monsters and throw the paintballs at the monsters to track them. Every zone was also separated by a loading screen which could slow the game down a lot depending on the system you were playing on. These were things some people defended as if the game wouldn t be Monster Hunter if they changed them but they ve changed them and the game is better for it. There are no paintballs in MHW. You don t have to carry anything craft anything or throw anything at the monsters to track them. In MHW you find monster footprints hair and scales and track monsters by scent like a dog. Their scents are visually represented by the scoutflies. The scoutflies are swarms of firefly looking bugs that lead you in the right direction and even highlight gatherable items like mushrooms herbs and more monster tracks. You gain experience tracking each monster as you collect more of their tracks and eventually you ll automatically start tracking a monster without having to find their tracks. You can also put a pin on anything on the map and have the scoutlies guide you to it. It doesn t even have to be a monster. You can have them guide you to a mining node if you want.Zone loading screens are completely gone in MHW. Monsters still run away into other zones each zone is still numbered on the map and monsters are still kind of tethered to one zone at a time there just aren t loading screens. Each level feels like a big open world but it's really not much different from how it was in the old games it's just bigger and faster. The core monster tracking and chasing game is still the same.Monster Hunter World is also really good at slowly introducing you to the game's mechanics and explaining things through tutorials and tooltips. The amount of info thrown at you in the beginning of the game is pretty overwhelming even for a MH veteran but you can always go back and read all of these tutorials again because the game saves them all for you. The game also keeps a detailed notebook full of monster weaknesses weak points and even loot tables. You can pull all of this stuff up any time you want too. Tooltips on rare monster parts even tell you what you have to do to get them. There's a small Wiki's worth of information built right into the game.Monster Hunter World introduces a ton of other improvements as well. You can now go to any area and freely explore hunt or farm herbs and mushrooms without taking some useless voucher turn in quest. Crafting has been greatly simplified. You don't need recipe books required materials have been reduced and the game even gives you the option to automatically craft any item when you get the required materials. You only get one Palico and they don't have talent trees anymore. All you need to worry about is their gear. You have access to food and your bank at the starting camp in every map so you can rebuff if you die change your armor and weapon and even store and restock items in the middle of a quest. You don't need to carry honey to make more Mega Potions anymore just fast travel back to camp and restock. Did I mention you can fast travel? You can open up your map and travel to any campsite you've discovered. Items like the whetstone bug net BBQ spit and fishing pole get their own dedicated inventory slots and the whetstone has infinite uses. There are no mining picks and you never put anything you carve from a monster in your bags so you have a lot more free bag space now. It also makes it so you never have to discard an item to loot a monster part again. There's too many things for me to list here but they all add up and make the game much more intuitive.Multiplayer on PC has been pretty iffy so far. A patch that fixes some of the network issues has been released now but online was a mess during the first week and a half after launch. It wasn t just when playing multiplayer either. Since you have to make online sessions when you start a game I would get huge lag spikes and disconnect messages even when playing alone. It got to the point where I would just start the game in Steam s offline mode to avoid these issues. There are still some problems especially during peak hours but the online is working much better now.Monster Hunter World has some beautiful graphics but it's the art direction that really makes them shine. Environments in MHW look natural and tell a story of their own. The way each zone blends into the next is seamless and makes sense. For example the desert area has a river going through the Western part of the map. The river starts at a waterfall in the North and ends in a muddy lake in the Southernmost section of the map where the mudskipper monster Yuratodus hangs out. There's tall grass around the river and cacti deep in the desert. The trails going from the river to the desert look like they were eroded by streams flowing down to the river like maybe this area floods sometime during the year or maybe the swamp covered more of the desert at one point.The game looks great but technically it s kind of a mess. Some issues have been alleviated with a recent patch but others remain. The most noticeable issue is the low resolution textures. For whatever reason the game doesn't load the high res textures even though they are installed on your computer. Modders have gotten them to load with mods so we know they re there. There are also major issues with one of the Elder Dragons Teostra and the last map Elder s Recess. This map has a bunch of lava smoke heat wave effects and a ton of sh,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD,1,

I have to start by saying that the quality of life aspects alone make this game AMAZING to play. Things are so much simpler to do now. Wanna gather that plant? Good just grab it while you are walking past it DONE. The removal of paintballs is also rather welcome IMO. Many of these reviews that are negative will point out the connection issues I will say that as far as I can tell since the recent patch these issues are FIXED. Game runs great even on rigs and the fact that you can have monster hunter and freedom of control is just amazing. Keyboard and mouse controls are great once you change them from the wack defaults.If you are a long time MH fan then GET IT hands down. If this is your first MH game then GET IT. Long time fans will appreciate quality of life things that have been done newbs will appreciate just how ing awesome the game is. My only note is that THIS IS A GRINDY GAME. If that is not your thing maybe don't get it unless you just wanna play through the story and be done cause realistically the story is 10% of the real game which is all the end game grind be it for decos or gearsets or w/e you like.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD,1,

Make sure you turn some useless settings off and you should achieve a good FPS value I heard volume rendering quality s your fps so I recommend turning it to low. Loading time has also been super fast even without an ssd. As for gameplay I felt a bit overwhelmed at the beginning cause its my first time playing this genre. But after a day of playing and some google searches its really easy to pick up all the mechanics in the game nothing hard to learn. There is a bit lack of missions and playerbase if you play from night midnight so I do recommend playing it in the morning or afternoon.The controls in this game is decent the default settings for mouse and keyboard aren't the best but they're easily customizable so no big deal.

809,"2018-08-10",0,0,230,0,0,In the current state of the game there are massive glaring issues that need to be patched before the game is ready for the $60 price tag.I love Monster Hunter as a series and the game itself can be quite fun. However due to the strange nature of Capcom's development process of putting the PC on the backburner it was quite a mistake that Capcom is already getting review bombed for.Let's go over why I cannot recommend the game The current anti piracy countermeasure in place Denuvo specifically makes the specifications seen on the store page effectively inaccurate. The game puts my CPU usage at 85% max despite my CPU being able to handle plenty of other games of a similar caliber without even reaching beyond half usage. It is a Intel I5 3330 3.0Ghz Quad core processor just a little bit below the minimum specs shouldn't be too much a problem as I've ran many other games below minimum. This game however gives me the issue despite the contrary on plenty of others. Inability to remove Depth of Field Motion Blur and the inability to alter visual effect quality or debris clutter quality. These are options that can help lower end systems run the game in a better fashion albiet with slightly uglier / bland looks. Motion Blur can also really hurt to look at for many players and after playing I understand why it must be sickening to look at. No raw mouse input do I really have to say anything here? The game does not have smooth mouse movement at all and it feels like you're moving your mouse on literal ice. You might as well play with a controller and dump KB+M if you're going to use the ranged weapons in game otherwise have fun with the sluggish control of the mouse. Multiplayer probably the worst thing out of everything in the list. I can only play quests with people who are at the same level as I am if not I have to play missions I've already done and that seals the deal. Until G rank comes out co op is strictly viable with anyone who's already on the same quest as you. The multiplayer servers are also garbage and disconnections are quite frequent ontop of this mess of a co op system. Don't plan on playing with friends if you want MHW unless you plan on playing at the exact same time on the exact same missions as they are.Despite these problems the underlying game is quite a blast and if you play Solo and have a high end desktop then this only might be worth $60. I paid only $49 at GMG so I saved a bit on the pre order thankfully hopefully it still is the same price but at the current state this is a steep amount Capcom is asking for and I don't blame anyone for wanting to skip this game if they can't play with friends or without crucial graphics / mouse control options.If the game gets patched to add critical elements and remove the awful features I'll consider putting my review into a positive review. Until then my opinion is rock solid and this game should only be bought on a sale (about less than 50% but knowing Capcom that probably won't happen for years),MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD,1,
810,"2018-08-10",0,0,108,0,1,"Try not to let the influx of bad reviews sway you too much. The game has just come out people want to be mad about something and most people I know had played it for 16 to 20 hours straight because they loved it so much. Those people aren't reviewing it. It's the people who want to be mad who are reviewing it.Now onto the port. The port isn't great. For the 6 months we had to wait for it it could have been better. But the DS1 port was god ing awful and people still found ways to play it. The loading times are crazy fast the graphics are super nice (although you need to disable a few things for optimization and that sucks) the systems that made sense on console have been changed to make sense on PC instead so they definitely thought about ""does this feature make sense on steam? How should we change it?""The game is a typical Monster Hunter. You fight monsters so you can farm it for a set that allows you to fight another monster which is just a stepping stone to a third monster ad infinitum. The combat is fluid and rewarding of skill and mastery and those who learn the ins and outs of their weapons and the monsters will be rewarded. I personally feel some weapons came out worse than previous games with their changes in mechanics or moves (Sword and Shield Dual Blades) but most got much much better when compared to the previous games with what was added to their arsenal. What makes this game such a definitive version over MHG on the 3DS or MGU on the Switch is the absolute colossal amount of Quality of Life changes. Gathering is faster so many of the crafting recipes were streamlined so you weren't farming for hours to make an ends game worth of one tool you needed. Things you needed for every hunt are always on your hunter at all times and don't take up inventory space. The new Charm systems the Armor and Weapon upgrade system and the new Armor Skills systems are all such a huge improvement over the old ones. The maps are sprawling and large without the loading screens that plagued the game in between zones of the same map in the old games. This is both a plus and a minus but they changed the potion drinking mechanic to account for that minus. It is clear Capcom put lots of thought and attention into this game. But it isn't perfect. In the old games it was impossible to do the main village quests with other people. Those were always solo offline only. The quest pool was separated and lots of things in the game were locked behind your solo progression in the game even things you needed for online play. They changed it and even though it is better than it was it's not as good as it should be. People who are complaining about the ""difficulty"" of playing with friends are blowing it so far out of proportion maybe they should seek a different game if figuring out how to play with friends is that hard. Also currently the servers are dying and you need to re host your game server occasionally if a friend gets dropped or you need to add a new one. Otherwise the game was amazing on the PS4 and it's even more so on the PC.",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD,1,

Highly Reccomend***Since the rest of the review is long winded I will say this If you have a very old CPU that makes use of FMA3 do not buy this game OR take 5 minutes out of your day to download a fix for your particular issue. This issue does not make it worth not reccommending because your CPU does not meet minimum requirements. Denuvo is not the problem your CPU is the problem.***Pros +Depth of combat+Depth of armory system+Unlimited storage for whatever you find in your hunts+Poogie+Palico's are a significant help in solo experiences+Each monster you face is a new adrenaline rush+Monster Diversity leads to each monster feeling awe inspiring+Earning a new piece of gear is extremely satisfying+The cutscenes are well crafted and a joy to experience+Armor and weapon looks and styles are varied and well designed+The weapons each have a unique style and are viable for each fight (Some are more optimal given certain situation)+Decoration system allows build flexibilty without having to get specific gear that may not be the best for what you are aiming for+Even if you beat the game the arena system is there for a fresh challenge no matter your current progress.Cons Multiplayer with friends can be a pain to set up at first Some portions of the game experience extreme spikes in difficulty Can be extremely grindy when it comes to getting specific items for gear Faints are shared across everyone on a hunt so if someone can't handle the fight they will pull you down Mods are not regulated and so some people have taken to modding the game to be one shot kills. This is very noticable in arena leaderboards. Mechanics are not always well explained. This can make you feel watching a youtube tutorial or two is needed.Overall At the time of writing the game has a 63% positive rating because of everyone quick to whine about the Denuvo CPU incompatibility issues. This game easily deserves a 95%+ rating. While it is not everyone's cup of tea it is by far the most accessable and most enjoyable Monster Hunter title to date and that means great things for those who are taking their first dip into the series.Review update Just about a month after launch adn the game is sitting at 47% reviews. A majority of recent reviews seem to be complaining about the server disconnection issue that plagued the game for the first couple of weeks of the game. For those curious I can assure you that as of the patch released on August 23 fixed this issue in 99.9% of instances. Do people experience a server hiccup and disconnect still? Not on a regular basis and its a rare instance if it does happen. Plus even if you do disconnect it takes no time at all to rejoin the same lobby you were just in. Put less stock in those who have decried the game for connectivity reasons make sure you have a PC that can run this game (exceeds all minimum specs) and look at the reviews actually talking about the content of the game to get an idea of what the game is like. So sick and tired of review bombing killing off good games because people are quick to judge.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD,1,

I think this is the biggest multiplayer mess up I've witnessed in 20 years of gaming. Even WoW's launch with the 3 hours queing times to enter the server was smooth in comparaison. In MHW you will encounter dozens of login attempts to join a multiplayer server before it works (happens all the time) random disconnects once you've started a mission (happens all the time) and random game crashs on top of it.I've decided to write this review because I'm trying to play a mission in multiplayer for the last 2 hours and a half and I can't get it to work not even for 15min straight without a random disconnection happening. I started it over maybe 20 times and yet the mission shouldn't last more than 10min if it worked properly.

Haha.The game went from disastrous release to a smooth sail in a couple of weeks. After a few tweaks and fix here and there from Capcom Monster Hunter World is finally enjoyable on PC. The most annoying issues I had before was connectivity and mouse camera control that feel sluggish (even though I mainly use gamepad but sometimes switch to mouse/keyboard). Now No more server issues. Mouse camera controls are very fluid.The graphic is certainly amazing. It is certainly a major improvement from previous installment in the series. Some people are complaining about low texture quality but I don't feel bothered with it because when I'm on the hunt don't usually pay much attention to it.The gameplay is challenging as ever with ridiculous hitboxes and the sluggish movement of your character even when using light weapon like dual blade or sword &amp shield. But all that hurdle will be rewarded with the iconic music at the end of the quest but with the most awkward last hit. ""A little poke to the toe of that Nergigante bam quest finished. Okay I guess let's carve it.""I think things that lacking now are the optimization of keyboard control (Rename loadout with escape? Oh come on. And don't forget to press F1 F4 first before using items in quest) and the lack of meaningful event. I get it baby steps toward better future right? But those steps're better be like Xeno'jiva's one or people will lose patiences with this already scarce roster of monsters.All in all I think this game deserve to be put in your library.

833,"2018-09-03",0,0,338,0,1,Now after taking 100 hours to complete the main story and screaming internally because of all the monsters by the end of the story I think I've seen enough to write a review. &gt As much as the multiplayer has been wonky since its release I've been able to play with my friends fine with very few issues. If the connectivity error occured we just rehosted the lobby. The gameplay is really good and me myself hasnt had that much of a problem of running the game. But there have been moments where it freaked out and froze on me or had severe fps drop. (not that many though.) I had the game freezing on me during multiplayer when I picked a quest.It's a good beginner game for people who want to start playing monster hunter and I love love love the fact that you can ask for help from other people while in a quest using the SOS flare or if they're in the same hub as you.I can however feel like the game is holding your hand quite a bit with all the vigor wasps filling up your item pouch and that you can eat during a quest. It soooort of removed a bit of the challenge that I've gotten in the previous games. But it's still great!Gameplay's great.Graphics are great. (I wouldn't mind if they added a way to remove the blurring of things or the bloom.)Multiplayer is... okay. There are some problems with voice chat sometimes and there are some weird connection things still.Soundtrack's amazing.All in all the experiece is amazing.I had expectations of this game and it went beyond it. I highly recommend it.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD,1,

WTF DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE AT ALL!But then... You realise that you just suck...At least you can get better...Really 1 for people who played other Monster Hunter games and enjoyed them.For people who haven't played any Look if you like the same type of games as this one Adventure Story Open World and more. One mission will take up to 50 minutes and can't be paused in this game even in offline mode!Remember this game is not your friend because sometimes it just wants you to not be able to move so that the monster can kill you.Also nice new updates!!!,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD,1,

838,"2018-08-13",0,0,162,0,1,The best damn monster hunter yet.Finally they got smooth and amazing graphics. The gameplay has added mechanics that make the combat smoother. The AI is alot more smoother and not so unrelenting as it used to be. You can finally bowgun without feeling gimped. It's quite balanced with melee and ranged so I love bow gunning in this MH.Only gripe is the constant online disconnects. But this game is selling very very well so it's servers are hammered.If you have not played a monster hunter game before you will need lube to make it through the first 24 hours of gameplay before you start to get good. Its like playing dark souls for the first time. You just have to git good. But don't give up the pay off is huge.I'm about 1/3 of the way through and I'm quite satisfied. Would recommend this game for any serious gamer. This isn't casual land where rainbow and unicorns exist. There is a ramp up to a high skill ceiling. It feels good to get there. The question is are you too casual or do you want to git good kid? Be the gamer we need. Show capcom how we reward good games that don't cater to casuals and instead reward skillful mechanical play.10/10 enjoy ),MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD,1,

842,"2018-08-22",0,0,245,0,1,"I have played a lot of monster hunter games over the years and when they announced that world was coming to PC I was super stoked. I played the game to vanilla game completion on PS4 but rebought it when it came to PC. I won't lie the game has connection issues but from my experience they haven't hit me too hard (every night my friends and I play for at least 4 hours and we run into issues maybe twice a night where we need to restart a hunt). I'm not saying that to belittle what other have said I just can only speak from my own experience. I do appreciate that Capcom has responded to the issue and says they are fixing it and the optimist in me wants to believe them. They have an amazing game here and this is the one major blemish for me.PROs This is by far the most approachable Monster Hunter game I've ever played. The quality of life changes to user interface/user experience are truly top notch. From things like the item wheel that lets you quickly select items to use the ease of gathering roughly 75% of gaatherables (not having to stop to collect bugs plants tracks etc) changes from using a paintball to scoutflies to track a monster a skill point versus skill number system wishlist for selecting items and SO MANY MORE. I went a bit insane there on my list but the sheer amount of QoL changes is mind boggling. The weapon combat is SO DAMN CLEAN. I keep jumping from weapon to weapon because the combat is so fun once you get the hang of a particular weapon. It have always loved certain weapons in each monster hunter but this is the first time I've been drawn to almost all 14 of them (I still love my Insect Glaive though). The game is pretty dang pretty. I mean I'm coming from Monster Hunter on 3DS and Nintendo Switch so I was expecting an upgrade but still it's reallllllly pretty. I love the increase in amount of monster interactions and how it is played out. You almost always have 3 monsters wandering around a map at once and they innevitably encounter each other resulting in a lot of interesting situations. I have seen ""Turf Wars"" that just leave me O_O and I've had monsters team up to screw me over (looking at you Rathalos and Rathian) that have me running away or quickly grabbing dung pods to get one to leave. Even when Bazelgeuse comes crashing in it's almost always hilarious (as long as I'm not getting hit). The maps are now one fluid environment instead of small areas like in previous games. I didn't realize how great this was until I went back to Generations on 3DS and had to chase a monster through 3 load screens / Xeno'Jiiva is just so pretty )CONs Connection problems are a big thing. Everyone has been talking about it and while it hasn't affected me too much I won't deny that it exists. I still recommend the game in spite of it but I am willing to deal with issues because the game is still stupid fun for me.EDIT As of the patch on 8/22 (US Time) I have not experienced any disconnects. There are some mutterings online of still having issues and I don't disbelieve them but since then I have been in about 20 different multiplayer hunts with no disconnects so for me the problem appears resolved. I'll update this later if the problems start cropping up again. It is behind the console version in content released which I can understand why but it still just makes me sad. I think this is only an ordeal for me because I played the console version and 90% of people won't feel this as an inconvenience like I do. Combat is still complicated even with the simplifications they have made. The game does not hold your hand and expects you to learn how monsters fight and how your weapon works. The best I can recommend is to look up guides if you need or just be ready for the game to be a bit mean to you. This is typical for monster hutners though just for reference.So obviously I'm in love with this game hopefully my review has been helpful. I think that the game is definitely worth the price tag even with the current connection issues. All of my friends are in love with it too if you are in question on it I recommend going and finding people streaming it on Twitch to see if the game is for you.Changelog 8/23 after patch connection problems have not occurred again.",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD,1,

844,"2018-08-11",0,0,59,0,0,Without a doubt Monster Hunter World is a fantastic game which could be considered one of the greatest JRPG franchises of all time. The game is an experience like no other in the genre. The game looks great the monster designs are awesome and terrifying the grind is exciting and not boring at all. However that does go without saying there have been quite a number of embarrassing issues for the PC Port. First of all we did not wait 6 months to play a console like experience. CAPCOM stated they are going to make us wait so that they can get the port just right for PC.This makes zero sense when you allow the following for a PC game No settings for Motion Blur Field of View Depth of Field + various other settingsMouse Acceleration (Seriously like why is this even a thing for a PC release...?)Also why Denuvo? I understand the need to stop piracy especially for a game as big as this but surely you could have done something else. I don't need Denuvo putting stress on my CPU especially when this game is very demanding on your CPU.A matchmaking system that makes it more difficult than it needs to be when playing with friends or strangers(Although the SOS is a great feature)Also to mention how they grossly underestimated the amount of players on launch and this sometimes means that the server will kick you out of a game with your friends for no reason other than a random error code (83 MW1) which likely means the network is understress. (Why cooperative play isn't peer to peer is beyond me..?)Lastly for a game marketed as a seamless co op experience why can't players view cutscenes together. It the most tedious thing to have all your friends go into an assigned hunt solo just so we can watch a cutscene and then leave the quest so then we can join the story quest together. Would it not have been better to just pre render your cutscenes instead at the sacrifice of some seamless gameplay so friends could enjoy the story together without breaking the immersion??Other than these few issues which need to be fixed as soon as possible as I said earlier the game is amazing with rich environmments to explore plenty of assignments and things to complete and do. The gathering hub allows you to fool around with friends (When the servers are working). Unfortunately though I'm going to set my review to red (no) until the issues are fixed. At this current time I can only reccomend picking up the game if you can afford to run the game (Optimisation is quite mixed for some) and if you're a diehard fan and can't wait to play. Otherwise wait for a sale to come up or for these aforementioned fixes to come through.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD,1,

850,"2018-08-30",0,0,146,0,1,This Review will be focusing on the game I am relatively new to the MH series this is the second Monster Hunter game I have ever played and I stayed blind throughout my playthrough (the other game being a PSP game back in 2011 casually). If you're looking for the port issues review scroll down to the END.TL DRGood game worth the price solid mechanics solid gameplay music a little loud in the city turn it down good variety very pretty areas. Fun side activities. Magic netcode no lag issues even when playing from people in other continents. Buy it.The GameStrongly 1 even at it's full price. It is a beautiful game the story is fairly standard but the core of the game is its fluid and fun gameplay.The environments are gorgeous the variety is great you can interact with pretty much any living thing in the world they succeeded in making the game trully feel alive.The music is great (albeit a little loud in the lobby/hub areas which can get a little annoying I turned it down).There is good Monster variety for the most part (though there ARE monster classes and model wise/classification monsters of the same class don't look THAT different from one another.Weapon variety is solid though a meta does exist apparently and its up to you whether you want to follow it or not I played to have fun.It IS a game about hunting monsters so well be ready to do that a lot you can go through the story without having to farm much though if that concerns you but again it's the core idea of the game so I'm not super sure why you'd not want to...Do that.. Moving on.The game also has a few side activities that you can partake on they're all fairly fun and in can assist the main hunting objective I won't spoil much in case you're new to the series or wish to keep everything fresh. But its a fair array of regular side stuff that is well done and feels accomplishing. PC Port issues For clarity I have played this game from start to end with Mouse and Keyboard. There are a few glaring issues with the PC Port of the game.Many things could be optimized in the UI and Controls.After fumbling about to find your pc shortcuts menu things sometimes randomly reset back to their previous configuration. (Apparently your shortcuts are tied to your Item Loadouts option meaning if you use the Loadout option for quick item setup (Which I suggest) make sure you save your re save your loadout after you change your shortcuts. I found this info in a Forum)Mouse acceleration by default ON and thats quite painful as there is (at the time of this review) no way to turn it off. Some control schemes and commands are locked to one button so you have buttons overlapping in functionality which can be a little annoying eventually you get used to it but that's not excuse.The connectivity issues of the lobbies have drastically decreased since launch though I see this mentioned a lot in older reviews so just letting you know that is no longer relevant.Video options are fine borderless fullscreen supported and all that other stuff.It's not the worst but could be better in a quite a few ways Capcom has mentioned they are still working on addressing a few things (they did have 7 months to port the game and some things still feel like they're fairly obvious issues that should have been captured early on but y'know) with the port issues so hopefully this section or at least the most critical ones.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD,1,

If you are hoping to play with friends lose the hope now and save yourself the heartache.Go buy drugs or something with the money that you would have spent on this game.

862,"2018-08-10",0,0,104,0,1,Everyone complaining about mouse acceleration can be ignored because if you're not playing with a controller you may as well not bother playing. Judging a monster hunter game by its mouse controls is ludicrous. As a console port I have had no problems with this game. With resolution scaling on high the game looks great even with most settings set to low. My cpu is literally a single iteration higher than the bare minimum required and the performance is fine and more than that is CONSISTENT. All the negative reviews complaining about incredibly minor and pedantic things like depth of field and bloom not being able to be turned off none of which have I even noticed which leads me to believe that these things can be turned off by lowering graphics settings but all the pc master racers havent even considered dropping from highest quality. The other complaint I've seen is that the game doesnt run well at absurd framerates like 2k or 4k with consumer grade hardware which like. That's your problem buy a normal person's monitor and you'll be ok. As for servers being bad my pc gets wifi from a ing usb wireless adapter and I was able to hunt with two of my friends and not have a single problem not any rubberbanding or disconnects. I suspect the bad server reviews are being left by americans who don't understand that the rest of the world has enormously surperior internet service to them.Ignore the haters this game is absoutely fine and well worth buying for pc.

868,"2018-08-10",0,0,1,0,0,My computer isn't the highest spec these days so I'll not harp on framerate issues. It actually performed about as well as I'd hoped which was fine. FWIW GTX 770 i5 16GB RAM.But... so many crashes. It crashed during the tutorial it crashed during the first mission it crashed after character creation.Also the controls are really clunky in my opinion. The camera auto moves with your character but also you have to manually turn it every time you want to go left or right etc. So it's a weird limbo of auto camera and not auto camera and it sucks.The combat feels kind of messed up too. One of my most effective moves was when the lizard monsters got behind me and I accidentally killed them with the windup of my swing. Is my sword an NES bad guy that kills stuff just from bumping into it?I'm pretty disappointed because I was really excited about this. I've been really interested in the idea of the Monster Hunter games but haven't had a gaming console in about 10 years so I was really excited when it came to PC. Maybe in 6 months when it's on sale for half off I'll forget how annoyed I was and buy it again. $60 is a no go for this monstrosity.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD,1,

873,"2018-08-26",0,0,103,0,1,"It surprises me this game's reviews are ""mixed"". But for those interested in buying this game it appears the core issue and why this game is getting mixed reviews is because of network issues on release and some of these issues can be attributed to Steam from my understanding. So by no means mistake it as being a mediocre game it is far from it. However my experience of these issues are far from game breaking but I've yet to have experience with matchmaking because I play with friends and we run private sessions. But it has been extremely rare that I've disconnected the core of the network issues I experience were in having people joining a session or quest and that was easily resolved by creating a new session or taking the quest down and putting it back up again.The good news Capcom have been patching these issues and I have noticed some of the issues go away including the ones I've mentioned above. We give MMO's the benefit of the doubt on expansion releases for network issues when there's a big influx of players I am prepared to give other online multiplayer games the same within reason. The game itself. Fantastic. It has performed solidly for me. The soundtrack is great the graphics look good and are fluid I love the attention to detail when it comes to ""most of our resources are from gathering mining and killing monsters"" so many of the weapons and armour you have take design cues from the monster parts you harvest to make them and you'll notice some cues in the architecture of things in Astera it feels like they have been living off of the land such as many things being made from bone. But ultimately the reason you buy this game is because you want to team up and hunt down ferocious and dangerous monsters and the game really delivers on it. They've put a lot of detail into their combat you have a plethora of weapon choices with their own unique playstyles and strengths and weaknesses you may attempt to use a weapon that's a good all rounder or swap your weapons out depending on what you're fighting. Some weapons are slow moving but hard hitting others are quick. Some are simple others are technical so you have plenty to choose from to find the one(s) to suit you. Personally I love the charge blade I can swap between sword and shield mode and a giant axe allowing me to be tanky when I need to take a hit as well as quick and nimble and then come in with heavy chops of the axe which is great for heavy damage and chopping off limbs. The monsters themselves there's plenty of variety in how they fight and often multiple fights with the same monster may not go the same way. Some monsters will attempt to be smart I recall early game a Kulu luring me into the den of an Anjanath a much tougher predator I was not yet equipped to beat and again luring me to the nest of a Rathalos which at a low level was not at all going to end well. Which brings me to another dynamic to the game that can add unexpected challenges to a fight other monsters may show. And because monsters are territorial they may not like another monster showing up for example Anjanath likes to be the apex predator of the forest but when Rathalos decides that she's the apex predator you end up with a turf war. Some times monsters showing up can be to your benefit like a Tzi Tzi who has a flash attack and often runs afterwards during my first Legiana fight he showed up and did that it took Legiana out of the sky and stunned her whilst I could then just pile attacks at that moment. Other times they can just make more difficult because they all want a piece of you. With monster fights and turf war there is one attention to detail that one can appreciate it's not just them wailing on each other but you will see certain traits of a monster exploited. For example a Paolumu showed up to turf war a Legiana so Legiana decided she wasn't having it grabbed Paolumu by his big fluffy mane and used it to body slam it. And the fights themselves it is useful to know a monster's strengths and weaknesses and how to exploit them. You have a whole arsenal to help you deal with it not just your weapons but a variety of items you can use you can knock your enemies out of the air stop them from burrowing stun them paralyze them and so on with items you carry with you. If you target certain limbs and areas of a monster and break them you can prevent them from doing certain things take the Tzi Tzi flash example its flash is done by a thing on its head you break that it will try to flash but find it doesn't go off. You have other options you can mount on the back of your enemy this can send them into a frantic rage to shake you off and it may work as an opportunity for your friends to wail on them it creates for some cool rodeo like moments flying through the sky on the back of a wyvern and if you are successful and don't get through off you can knock your enemy down for a count. You can sleep your monsters and one of our favourite tactics sleep them surround them with barrel bombs and have our heavy bow guns drop mortars onto the barrels and just watch a flurry of explosions. In terms of challenge the game makes you work for it and get better there are moments where the difficulty spike is higher but in some ways rising to that challenge ends up making you better. Because you a fighting giant epic monsters this is very rewarding especially if it's an intense fight. Because of how dynamic monster fights can be after nearly 60 hours of gameplay I've yet to feel a grind although there is a grind aspect to it so you can make near gear and weapons but to me this game demonstrates what a grind should be enjoyable and not feel like you're doing them same thing over &amp over and to give enough reward for winning for it not to get tedious. Is it worth the 49.99? Hell yes. I am addicted to this game and think they've done a fantastic job. I've never played a Monster Hunter game before and this has worked out to be a brilliant introduction to it. I recognise it is not perfect and there are some niggles the network being one another quality of life things would be nice you cannot cancel some actions once you've started them as an example which can make some weapons frustrating when you want to change your mind because a monster has changed their tactic unexpectedly and you can't react.But overall it is a great game.",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD,1,

875,"2018-11-03",0,0,187,0,1,If you like collecting things and farming item drops in games this does those things very well. If you really don't like repetition to craft items and such the game may be unappealing. The main story itself I think is worth it but if you do like that farming then the game really shines. The story is extremely cheesy but the game seems to embrace that and I've grown to appreciate it.I personally find exploring the various areas to be very satisfying. The game has 3D level design on a level that was often ignored in earlier 3D games where maps were usually mostly 2D. There is an impressive array of weapons supporting a wide variety of play styles.My friend really nagged me to get this game and I did. It's the first time I put any serious time into the series and I love it. At nearly 150 hours now I've easily gotten my money's worth several times over. Read the actual reviews rather than looking at the score and look at the graph to see how certain days the game really was review bombed with statistics that don't at all match the reviews on most days. Most of the negative reviews are either about launch issues that have long since been fixed or nitpicking about wanting content ported from the console version sooner often by people with many dozens of hours played. I had planned to make a more thought out review but I summarized my thoughts because seeing contant negative reviews from people with dozens of hours played as a soap box for nitpicks is a real shame. As a newcomer to the series seeing the complete disconnect between the game's real reception and the review score shocked me. The game isn't for everyone especially for those that don't like farming items to craft but I think it does what it does extremely well and Capcom is clearly giving the game ongoing support.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD,1,
876,"2018-08-09",0,0,113,0,1,One complaint BRING BACK THE OVER THE TOP BLOOD GUSHING FROM THE MONSTERS. Been playing Monster Hunter since the 2004 release of Monster Hunter on Playstation 2. I've followed the franchise on several devices like PSP iOS Nintendo Wii U/3DS and XBOX. I've played each game and haven't missed any releases. This game is in a genre of its own.Monster Hunter World is the most ambitious game in the franchise adding complexity and an open world feel. The first few hours of the game is explained quite well for new players but if you're not new then you already understand how this game unfolds. There are 34 monsters in the MH World in the console version the PC version may lack a few but it should have several patches to add in some of the new ones along with future ones once the PC version catches up with it's console predecessor. Each Monster has it's own attack pattern so rememeber to take a step back when engaging with one and observe it's pattern. Don't get to greedy when fighting one and dodge always! Once killed a monster you will sheath your weapon and start skinning them for materials you will then take those mats and use them at Astera's smithy and will allow you to craft many sets of Armor that will help you with upcoming fights. There are 14 different weapon types most of them play differently but there will be a few that might play smiliar there should be enough to fit anyone's playstyle. Overall this game is a glorifed progression griding game. It does it well with its awe enviroements and badass fighting mechanics. Something I want to see added from Capcom is a DLC for a High Resolution texture pack similar to what FFXV did. Not taking away anything from the graphics because the game is beautiful but I know Capcom can do more with some of today's best computer builds.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD,1,

880,"2018-11-26",0,0,258,0,1,Ok so I am writing a review. One of the few I ever do. But I will forgo the formalities.. Firstly this game is not like WOW. Never is never will be. Instead it has a feel of a couple of other games (God Eater 2 Destiny 2 Dauntless). And those are just to name a few... If your a first time gamer in the world of Monster Hunter World. there is a lot to take in... Creating a character is fast. And then there is your pet Palico. And yu get to name him/her... Once in the game you are given several options to work with. Firstly you have the small story opening to contend with. (in which I was not sure what was happening for a few moments and then was bedazzled at how the play was progressing for me) Once you are in game you will have some simple little tasks to do.. But once you work on getting yoru footing in game. It becomes a bit easier to traverse.. Areas are locked till you do the appropriate missions to unlock areas. Also when running around it pays to talk to EVERYONE everywhere. As more will open to you in game as you learn who to talk to always.. And what to look for. As for being a single player game it is ok for some parts. But not every part of the game can be done as a solo. You will be required to party up or even send a flare to get random help from other players (note when yuo do a flare. Anyone and everyone can come to your aid. So don't be surprised to see some very high level come in to help even other who may be lower level. As long as they have that mission open to them (depending on level)) Just a quick note you will notice you have a net in your inventory. It is great for capturing small creatures. They are just decorations for your place. But hey your place will look boring with out a bit of wildlife to spice it up a bit... So don't be afraid to get some captures.. Even fish can be caught) Most of all just enjoy...,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD,1,

The main complaint I keep seeing is ""consoles are getting new stuff blah blah I want all the same dlc!"" But wait just a second... Let s say they release... ALL the dlc... Day one... all those events? gotta do them now... and fast. They have to do it just like they did the consoles and let loose the slowly otherwise your a**hole is going to be the size of Texas from the sh*t you gotta pull and you ll be so overwhelmed that you re not going to get anything done... So sit back and relax. We re going to get the dlc a tad faster which isn t that great to begin with. Farming is a stable to the end game I d rather have 3 events (worth doing) then 9 at once just so we can play catch up.

884,"2018-08-29",0,0,178,0,1,Monster Hunter World is an excellent game for newcomers to experience the world of monster hunting and want to get their foot into this series. Unlike the previous titles theres are fewer monsters (at this point) but as well a complete quality of life changes Pros +No pickaxe required saving space and no need to carry them.+Nets for capturing small monsters is also unlimited and no need to carry them wasting inventory space+Plants and locale life is easily identified by the scoutflies+Investigations arenas special events.Cons Certain armors still have a low resolution while some sets will look HDNeutral Mouse and keyboard have been updated and implemented but I have been using a controller.Connectivity issues are still around after the DmC event that has been added.Above was a few pros and cons that I found with the game and may vary from user to user. Some players will be seeing the same cons as I would and some other users may have more problems or less depending on hardware. The one thing I wish Capcom would do is allow a timed or limited demo to allow players to see how it runs for them.Overall I am having a lot of fun with MHW and hoping to see it get better in quality along with future updates.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD,1,

887,"2018-08-29",0,0,70,0,1,"Singleplayer The Singleplayer Story is something whole different to other Monster Hunter titles. It is catchy and very interesting. The high rank quests have an interesting explanation because of the eco system and everything. It feels like you are a real hunter in this ""new world"". Multiplayer The Multiplayer is why I play this game mainly. Grab 3 Friends and Hunt Monsters down with them. It is really fun and well done with the servers. Sometimes the servers bug but its rare. One thing is really annoying You can t start the Storyquests with your friends everyone needs to start it solo (see the cutscene) and leave the quest so we can start together. This is a big issue for me and it feels weird for such an online title Monsters The monsters feel way much real than in other titles you need to track them now. They will leave traces which your character smells. You see the damage you give to the monsters which is nice tho. Monsters now fight each other now more realistic they have now a animation for eating them and everything. So nice *_* Environment/Maps Very confusing the forest looks the same everywhere I cant use the map properly because the maps have mulitple floors now which is new for me. I liked the old map system better I think. But this is a personal oppinion. Loot options are now listed on the map which is nice looting is faster. This sounds like a pro but its a con for me I think the animation in which the character loots and you shouldnt get hit in it was more exciting the sound which played in older titles when you loot something was so unique and it gave a nice feeling to looting. D Weapons They have every weapon ever made in Monster Hunter titles but when you choose yourself for one its not really a different feeling when you upgrade them. The looks change rarely and they often look the same. I liked the difference when you upgrade the weapons so i miss it a bit. The weapon tree is awesome I finally can craft my weapons without opening the wiki first. The feeling with the weapons in fight is nice tho I just miss the upgrade differences.

That's all you should need.I personally haven't had any problems with in game performance or connectivity only a few blips that were very early after release which are understandable considering the amount of people trying to access multiplayer at once. As of writing I've played all of today (2 days after release) with no multiplayer issues whatsoever.Currently running on an i5 4690k 970 and 8GB of RAM on high with little to no frame drops or performance issues so just make sure your PC is reasonable and you should be fine. Denuvo also hasn't been a problem. As long as you don't have a potato PC and can connect to the internet (which you should be able to considering you're downloading a game on steam and you're getting a game with a large amount of multiplayer) then you shouldn't have any problems. I don't support Denuvo in the slightest but I don't see why people decide to cry about it and stop themselves from enjoying a great game.Tl dr game good,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD,1,

894,"2018-08-09",0,0,147,0,1,I'm 1 hour in and I'm loving it so far.I've dedicated 5000 hours of my life to this franchise (mhfu mh3u mh4u mhg) and I'm more than ready to invest a few thousands more. However as a veteran who started playing with mhfu on PSP I'm not too enthousiastic about some QOL changes (damage numbers lock on infinite whetstones walking while drinking potions). They trivialize the game a bit. Having a second stick for a camera instead of using the D pad in mh3u was a blessing that was necessary but I feel they should have stopped there in terms of accessibility.But at the same time those changes make MHW the best entry point ever for new hunters. So if this results in attracting and keeping more players good. Like most things in life MH is amazing with friends. This is where Monster Hunter really shines.If you're new to Monster Hunter the gameloop is simple. You kill monsters You carve them You craft better gear with the monster materials You kill bigger monsters It's a grindfest but it's so goddamn rewarding and fun to play.8.5/10*****SYSTEM INFO Cpu ryzen 7 2700x Gpu gtx 1060 6gbGame runs like a charm on the high preset with 60fps.

895,"2018-08-18",0,0,215,0,1,This game is amazing through and through. Those that disagree honestly wouldn't know quality if it hit them in the face. It only sits at a mixed rating because of the connection issues it has atm which has already been addressed. A fix is coming. The game is 100% worth it for the solo play alone. The whole whining about it being a bad port thing its not. I've gotten used to the Kb &amp M just fine. I don't see a problem with the menu controls. If your fps sucks get off your toaster and stop trying to make your rig do something it can't. Game runs at a solid 60 cranked on a 1080.The reverse mouse acceleration or whatever it has is 100% crap. Also extremely easy to fix. If you can change your dpi set that low and in game mouse sensitivity up. Bam done. Simple.The cutscene after the final monster can also permanently not work on some computers for whatever reason locking you out of progressing to end game. Currently not a super easy work around but still do able with help from another that can get past it via sending them your save so they pass it for you. Looking at any outlit talking about this game anyone would have seen this issue and avoided it. There will obviously be a fix for this as well.All in all. Amazing game. People will always find something to complain about. Buy it.Before slamming the game take 5 minutes to see what you can do to make the game run/feel great and how to avoid/protect yourself from certain issues. It's not hard.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD,1,

In the beginning there was connection issues but that is to always be expected with a game that just released. If you think a game is perfect on release day then get off your computer and go find something else to do. The graphics are great. The combat is awesome. I have no issue navigating through any of the menus. Should you use a controller for this? Absolutely. So if you're really a PC gamer then you should already have a controller ready to go. It's a great version of monster hunter that came out. I'm looking forward to seeing more monsters and updates added to it. Worth buying now.

912,"2018-08-15",0,0,200,0,0,I want to preface this by expressing that I have been playing monster hunter for years. I remember sitting around on the floor with all my friends basking in the game bugs and all and when we heard about monster hunter world we were over the moon. We waited for the pc edition to be released months after the console editions thinking that if it made the port better then we would be fine to wait although the time seemed excessive for a port. I purchased 4 copies for my friends and myself so we could all play together.Let me start with the mechanical problems. Monster hunter world is about as well optimized as the first darksouls port. The menus were built for a controller. You cannot hit the space bar to confirm dialogue options or choices and you cannot click anywhere on the screen but the extremely small confirmation buttons. This doesn't sound like much until you consider the overly cluttered screens the small buttons and how much time it takes to use the mouse so unintuitively when most keyboard gamers are in the habit of shortcuts to ease some of those aspects of the game. This is annoying considering the amount of time that was supposedly put into optimizing the game. This is the first sin.The second sin comes in the way of unskippable cutscenes and on an artistic note that some might agree with the same ham fisted dialogue that is expected from monster hunter games. They make you follow around an incompotent woman designated only as 'The Handler' and the cutscenes are both tedious and draining. They add little in the way of story other that directing you towards the next monster to beat up and while I can understand some games that go this route the unskippable cutscened are the focal point of the reason I regret spending a single dime on this ridiculous excuse of a game. Err12.The game crashes constantly. Capcom blames Nvidia or AMD of whomever they're trying to pawn this t off onto now but here's the deal. Those unskippable cutscenes? Yeah they lag the entire system to and force the graphics drivers to shut down because the game has been so poorly optimized that it's attempting to load in THE ENTIRE GAME during the cutscene and rounding back to the second sin of unskippable cutscenes there is no way to progress in the game because YOU CANNOT GET PAST THE CUTSCENES.I have a decent rig. gtx980 i5 6600 I don't lag or experience a single issue in any other game. I have rolled back my drivers I have worked on every hotfix i have done everything in my power to play a ing game that I paid for and it is literally unplayable. I tried the steam cloud trick to bypass potentially corrupted documents after reinstalling redownloading and managing my settings to the absolute lowest they could go and when I restart the game (that is supposed to sync data directly from the steam cloud) it now says my game never existed despite there being 9mb of used data in the cloud and when I am forced to watch the introductary cutscene again it crashed completely. Err12.This is appauling. Out of our 6 group 2 people can't play at all my own furious included. So from a long time fan and someone who counted down the days to this launch you Capcom.9/1/2018 Update A continued ' you' to Capcom. Err12 persists as well as connection issues and other bugs that make the game literally unplayable. One of the 'work arounds' listed on the subreddit was to backup your save to the steam cloud and delete all local content. This in theory was supposed to allow any corrupted files the chance to install properly but there's no way to download my character. So the few quests that I had been able to do between crashes is lost and I had to see if I could make a new one. Now instead of having any play time at all the game crashes on the first unskippable cutscene after creating a character.I want my ing money back. The play time that I have has been trying to get the ing game to run and not actually playing. This is the worst port I have ever seen and it doesn't matter what I do to my graphics driver the game is a ing mess. you Capcom. You should have a ing taskforce on these issues instead of releasing additional content for the wide range of sales achievements you've met it doesn't ing matter if no one can play the game. you.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD,1,
913,"2018-08-16",0,0,235,0,1,"This is my first jump into the Monster Hunter franchise and I'm hooked. As long as you don't have an outdated PC you won't run into too many issues. I""ll address some things I've experienced in the review since I just finished the campaign (with around 60 hours played).Poor Multiplayer Design and Network Issues This was a surprise... A game released in 2018 has really poorly designed multiplayer where you have to jump through hoops to join your friends on a hunt. You can't play through the campaign with a friend without re hosting each quest in order to meet the requirement that you've all watched the cutscene.""But that's only the campaign which is such a small part of the game! It's basically a tutorial! You should be soloing those fights anyway!"" some veteran MH players (I don't agree with this at all)Why not let players form a party within their session and allow them to queue up for the next Assignment quest together if they're both on that quest?There have also been network issues and I've disconnected from a couple hunts and it's really frustrating because once the monsters scale up to multiplayer they do not scale down. Capcom is looking into this issue right now and hopefully it'll be fixed.P.S. I've actually done hunts with random groups for the majority of my time and it's been perfectly fine except for a few disconnects. (like 2 out of 100ish hunts). Players join almost instantly after I fire off the SOS flare. I wish they had designed the UI better but it does what it's supposed to do.Not Optimized? I have a decent 2 year old PC (i7 6700k GTX 1070) and I haven't run into any issues except some frame drops during the Teostra fight. It runs at a buttery locked 60fps most of the time and super fast loading times.I also have not encountered the save bug after the final boss fight. I put a question mark at ""Not Optimized?"" because it's okay for a game to be demanding hardware wise. If you have an older PC and you're running into a lot of issues it may be time for an upgrade.Mouse Control / Raw Input If you were planning on using a mouse+keyboard setup forget about it. The mouse input mimics a controller analog stick and is just atrocious. I was actually really excited to play with a bow and M+KB but I'm playing with my DualShock4 and maining Charge Blade. The controls are really intuitive and the controller feels great but I wish I could've used a M+KB since that's what I'm most familiar with.All the shortcomings are minor and will be addressed in due time. The core gameplay is fantastic and the experience is worth every penny.Would I recommend this game in a heartbeat to any serious gamer? HELL. YES.Pick it up right now and join in on the hunt. It's seriously a blast.",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD,1,
914,"2018-08-27",0,0,303,0,1,One of the greatest games of 2018. Capcom is finally getting rid of all those archaic mechanics from the PS2 era and gives the monster hunting genre the game it deserves. World does everything better than previous Monster Hunter titles. The only things where it's lacking is the amount of monsters and the absence of the G Rank difficulty. But that does not mean there's nothing to do or that it's too easy. This game gives you hundreds of hours of content and enough challenges to keep you busy for a long time. Buy now!Update By now I have played around 300 hrs on PS4 and more than 260 hrs on PC and I'm still not bored of this masterpiece! The people at Capcom are working hard to keep improving the game and adding new content. For free! New Monsters weapons skins events and you dont have to pay anything after you purchased the game. You can of course buy some extra emote animations chat stickers or NPC costumes but none of these are actually useful ingame and they're not hidden in some random gambling mechanism. You get what you pay for if you wish to do so. You don't miss out on anything if you don't.If you still haven't buy now!,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD,1,

The game looks amazing and even with a lower end PC i can run it on max settings with zero FPS drop the controls are very fluid and the combat is like nothing i have ever seen. even after 50 some odd hours (Xbone and PC mix) it still hasnt gotten old and i still feel like i haven't done everything. The story is kinda predicatble and boring but there isnt much story to begin with and it isnt the main focus of the game anyways.In all i would have to recommend this game. even if you just want to play it solo. its very much worth the $60 price tag that it holds. and once you get the online working its a blast with friends.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD,1,

But other than that the games key board and mouse controller scheme is utter trash and its feels just like a generic port can't see why we had to wait months on it. If you own this game on console please don't bother picking this verison up because you'll most likely be playing with a controller anyway. But if you are new to the series this game is 9/10 worth buying just for the playability &amp the quility content which once you get past the clunky nest in the menu's and crafting is a beautiful and highly engageing enviroment.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD,1,

938,"2018-08-16",0,0,392,0,1,This is a great game and I'm going to recommend it as the gameplay alone justifies the purchase. That said this is a really lazy port and the studio behind it should be embarrassed at the low quality of the product they're selling. I play to write a more detailed review later but for now I'll just say the multiplayer code is buggy and the options don't even try to conform to the standard PC users are used to. Still if you are willing to look past that the game offers the highest quality gameplay experience which is even better with friends. (When it works.)*Edit So it seems like they cleaned up the multiplayer code a bunch as I don't have nearly the amount of problems I used to. That said I hope the next game does a better job at matchmaking options as finding the hunt you want can be tedious. The game itself is solid but I do have a few complaints just in case a developer ends up reading this.1. Have control setup options that work for mouse/keyboard users. I shouldn't have to press an f key to bring up my quick menu I should be able to map buttons to my mouse or keyboard that just let me quick select certain items (of my choice). It's super clunky as is and takes away from the fun factor.2. Give us damage meter options. The awards at the end of the hunts are laughable I don't need to know who grilled the most steak. Let me know damage blocking stunning sleeping and other relevant combat stats so I have an easier time improving my performance.3. Either make things more intuitive or give your players better tutorials.4. Your pterodactyl crashing randomly adds absolutely nothing to the game please do away with that crap.Those are my four main complaints 300 or so hours in.

Sure it has some muddy textures but the game still has great visuals and if the textures being muddy on occasion is the worst thing then that's fine. The only issue i had with the game was when i decided to play with friends. The game has connection issues when you play co op but its day 3 its expected that any game will have issues in its first week.

951,"2018-08-10",0,0,242,0,1,I played the original all the way back in PS2 I had the ethernet adapter and keyboard for the console it stood as one of my two favorite games of all time. I am not a fan of handhelds and the Wii game was disappointing to me. Finally after so long I have the Monster Hunter game I wanted. This game is fantastic and I hope they add more creatures from the originals overtime (Fatalis maybe? Tigrex?) but the ones here are visually impressive and the animations are really good. I am enjoying it so far.If you are a veteran to the series like myself you may notice a few changes here and there at first it makes it look a bit easier than the originals but the game kept all of its wonderful challenge and progression ideas while making some quality of life adjustments. I was concerned with the lock on mechanic (I thought it could make the game too easy) turns out it is not that bad and contributes to a tighter and controlled fight while still requiring you to make precise inputs of evade defend or attack. I highly recommend it for you. I you like easier games (open world sandboxes especially the recent ones) that don t require quick decision making every second while also not very challenging I do not recomend this game for you. Hunts are demanding and need to be so it can provide the epicness when you fell a creature you been fighting / hunting for nearly 50 min.My opinion this Monster Hunter is brilliant and for years I did not get this excited for a game. My expectation was high this game delivered to me.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD,1,
952,"2018-08-16",0,0,137,0,1,This game is by far the most enjoyable MH game I've played however the multiplayer issue on PC release completely ruins the whole experience for me imagine 10 minutes into a quest and someone DCs from the session and that person struggles to complete the quest because the difficulty DOESN'T scale back down from multiplayer so the boss still have so much HP. And this happens constantly every couple of quests it's a horrible experience.Pros ++ Graphics++ Beautiful maps++ Soundtrack+ Improved mechanics / gameplay from previous MH games+ Stable port I've put 100 hours in and my game hasn't ran into any issues / crashed onceCons MULTIPLAYER CONSTANTLY DISCONNECTS PEOPLE MID QUESTEDIT Ever since patch I haven't gotten a single DC nice ) Main story quests that have cutscenes that cannot be watched together with friends resulting everyone have to watch the cutscene by themselves and then start a new quest to play together.

955,"2018-12-21",0,0,217,0,1,I've played MH since the game came out on the Wii. Since then I played most of the DS games and loved them all. The game simplifies many features mostly the skills on equipment which is arguably good and bad I think most people struggle getting through the early game. It's not like most games these days where you start up and you're ready to fight other players or have the best weapons etc. It definitelly takes time and devotion. I looked through other reviews and to start off I recommend watching a few videos about the game. The game is both easy and hard but it only gets hard when you get to the late game and the stream of updates that capcom releases almost weekly. These updates include crossover events with other games and special weapons and armor. That being said the other issue people have is the controls. I haven't played the PC controls but many MH veterans I've heard were satisfied but I still highly suggest using a controller. It's somewhat similar to dark souls but you can't just evade everything. You don't have I frames so you need to learn the monsters movements and to play effectively. Lastly the game isn't perfectly optimized. The game had some issues but most are fixed now. My biggest complaint is the lack of ultra wide support but I love the game so much that it doesn't bother me. If this is your first MH experience you likely will care more about graphics looking like most AAA titles. However considering capcom went from 3DS games to this it's about the same as a gameboy to a PS3. Capcom makes an effort to fix bugs and release content at a stable rate. Reviews are mixed but most are issues on release and the port having bad localization and server issues. Most of these are fixed now and the game has it's flaws but its a great game that can be played competetively with speed runs and gear grinding or casually with a group of friends and fighting simple monsters for fun. I highly recommend the game and with the DLC coming out there will be nearly double the content in 2019. Hope you all enjoy and happy hunting!,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD,1,

The impact on some of your blows actually hitting a monster is highly satisfying.Where the game truly shines is in the multiplayer. Hunting monsters with a party is a beautiful thing and a large amount of the game emphasizes this. Meal Vouchers which allows everyone in your server to eat once for free S.O.S. flares to get help mid mission and entire gathering hub solely there for the multiplayer experience. Playing with your friends is where this game really shines which is largely why the review is negative. Error Code 5028F MW1. You'll see a LOT of this if you decide to play online. Attempting to join an online session go ahead and take a quick bathroom break grab some tea it's likely to take a minute to matchmake a session. Then don't get used to staying in said session for long. That error messager is there to tell you that mid fight with whatever beastie you were hunting you've been booted. Either you're not connected to the server anylonger or your help got disconnected. Always that error code. 5028F MW1. You're no longer connected to an online session.

Either way the constant disconnections seem to have been fixed for the most part.Audio is still relatively low searching online seems to suggest changing volume settings every time you open the game but I've learned to live with it.The game will occasionally freeze on me during the results screen but goes back to normal when I leave it running for a good thirty seconds.I still stand by what I said in my prior review the game formula is still Monster Hunter but the overall theme is a bit too safe. No more wacky monster designs and movesets no more flashy moves (although they kept some of it and integrated them within weapon combos) and no more convenient online multiplayer. If anything my biggest gripe is how the game handles online interactions but as a game Monster Hunter World passes with high marks.9/10 play it with a controller. It's truly the best way to experience this game. Or don't whatever. As of August 19 2018Graphics Card has crashed (I'm on a 1070 fixed this by setting Video to Borderless Fullscreen)Disconnected from server 50 times now (playing solo and with friends)Insane frame drops once every 2 hours (managed to ""fix"" this by disabling volume rendering)Audio is ridiculously low (still don't have an answer for this)Multiplayer stability is worse in comparison to the 3DS/Switch counterparts (UX in general for online is a mess)Gameplay is still MonHun albeit too safe (no more cool laser dragons flashy sparks fun stuff from previous gen)As of now I'd only recommend buying it if you either really love the franchise or if you have someone to play with. I'm luckily on both but that makes the problems more glaringly obvious.8/10 my graphics card ""crashed"" and I lost almost an hour of progress",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD,1,

Mouse is basically useless for this game and I am not willing to spend even more money on a console for a game that already sucks. It's so hard and tedious to navigate menu. It's also really hard to switch tabs when I'm running Monster Hunter. I can't quit the game unless I wait for the loadscreen (fast I admit) or end task via Task Manager. The game is so laggy when you have more than one person fighting a monster. I can't optimise the graphics as much as I'd like to or remove particles. I really despise this abomination.

My personal experience has been good though I get a solid 60 fps with no dips while playing at the highest graphic settings. I have experienced a few disconnects during a hunt which can suck but you are still able to finish the quest solo. Also the game is great! Played it on PS4 when it first came out but it runs so much nicer and prettier on PC. Been playing the series since they were on the PSP and this is probably my favorite installment. So I recommend it but you might want to wait for them to patch some of the issues first or wait for it to come on sale if you're not sure if it's for you. ),MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD,1,
987,"2018-08-31",0,0,487,0,1,Monster Hunter World is the eagerly anticipated follow up to the console version which released earlier in the year. Full disclaimer I'm not a big Monster Hunter fan I've played Generations on the 3DS and one on the PSP years ago and hated how clunky they felt. Does that change with World? ...Sort of.Essentially Monster Hunter World (MHW) is a very simple premise Kill or capture ever increasingly difficult monsters for their body parts from which you craft better weapons and armour. Rinse and repeat for hundreds of hours. However you have wide variety of weapon types to choose from (14 in total) each with its own special characteristics and preferred way to engage a monster.Combat in MHW will feel slow and clunky if you're more used to high speed action games like Devil May Cry. This means you have to be patient and exploit openings whenever you can. Many of the late game monsters can easily kill you if you mess up so learning their movesets is really important. You also have a partner called a Palico (which is basically a cat) who fights with you and can bring some really useful tools to heal you tank damage or even steal items from monsters. Plus you can deck your Palico out in its own armour which are often incredibly ridiculous or cute.The story is a mixed bag. There are some genuinely amazing moments but they're somewhat ruined by the irritating Handler and absolutely stupid multiplayer restrictions. For those not aware if you want to go through the story with a friend you both have to separately make a quest both 'discover' the monster then have one player join the other. You can't just start the quest together if one of you hasn't seen the cutscene for a monster. It's incredibly irritating particularly as almost every quest has a cutscene and the story is pretty long (approx 50 60 hours if you pace it). However once you beat story you're free to run any quest you're high enough level for and you have a lot more freedom. Honestly just get through story as quick as you can and then enjoy the real game grinding Elder Dragons.Visually MHW looks very good although there are a few issues here too. One of the Elder Dragon fights has very noticable slowdown whenever he does certain attacks (and this is happening to people with high end gaming rigs) plus some of the textures aren't particularly high quality either.One of the best things about the game is how real the environments feel. Monsters will sleep eat and act as you would expect an animal to act. Smaller herbivore monsters will often try to run whenever a predator gets near. When two large monsters meet you'll often get a 'turf war' where both of them will fight and do huge amounts of damage to each other. It's amazing to see for the first time when the monster you were hunting gets annihilated by something even bigger! (RIP Great Jagras)Overall I would recommend MHW but there are a few areas that badly need to improve The multiplayer experience is littered with random disconnects and being unable to find sessions. Capcom are aware of this and trying to fix it. Slowly the experience is improving but it's not fixed yet. Slowdowns/freezes. In addition to the Elder Dragon I mentioned above the game likes to stutter/freeze occasionally.Honestly if you have a PS4 or an XBox One you may be better buying that version which also has all of the DLC monsters like Deviljho and Behemoth. If you don't have one of those consoles the PC version is still very good and will be excellent once the bugs are ironed out.If I had one bit of advice for new MH players Learn how to superman dive before Nergigante.

993,"2019-01-25",0,0,50,0,1,Monster Hunter World is a game that rewards precision. Taking the time to gather tracks and research monsters grants knowledge of their strengths weaknesses and vulnerabilities making your hunter that much more deadly and the monsters' health pool that much more insignificant. Taking the time to master a weapon's intricacies grants outstanding combos and impressive finishers making each swing of your weapon a dazzling display of finesse and relentless damage output. Taking the time to learn a monster's moveset enables a nonstop offensive via utilization of precise i frames embedded in your dodge rolls. Monster attacks? You time your dodge and leave that monster empty handed.Master these core gameplay mechanics and you'll be turning even the biggest and baddest of turbo lizards into a hat so posh you won't even care what kind of garbage armor skills it has.In all seriousness I've already put 500 hours into the console version of this game here's to another 500 on PC.

995,"2018-08-15",0,0,424,0,0,The gameplay in general is good when it comes to the hunts and the amount of customization is great.

It also takes way too long to go through the item screens between the pouch and stash box to make any sense. The way you use the light bowgun is not intuitive at all. There is a great port in there somewhere but it is not there yet and if you haven't bought the game i would say hold off until it becomes better because if you play any rpgs at all on PC this one is not optimized for play at all.

I remember spending late nights just trying to beat that monster that had been kicking my for weeks so please understand that this comes from a place of love. This game is everything I have wanted in a monster hunter game but Denuvo makes it worthless. EVERY game with it has taken my computer with a titan X video card intel i7 processer and taken frame rates from 60+ to 3 at the most. A new verion came out that claimed to fix all of the problems but it didn't it is just as bad as before and Capcom should not get another cent until they fix it. STEAM is DRM why do you need more?!? there is a communiety of 1 000's of people online waiting for it to be cracked because they would rather wait the week or so its going to take and never play it online rather than deal with denuvo. keep in mind this game is one step away from a MMO it is built around having fun with your friends and I wish I had waited.If you need a monster hunter game there is competition on steam itself. Toukiden 2 is great and no denuvo or DRM. godeater is also good does have an older version of Denuvo however.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD,1,
998,"2018-09-26",0,0,465,0,1,Product received for free. Well now that the servers are working properly you have no reason not to buy this game. As a fair warning to anyone looking to buy this game it does have a somewhat steep learning curve. This game expects your attention if you slack off once during any of the monster fights especially any tempered monsters you re done for. Often times you ll get a feeling of frustration that the game is unfair but that s only on your first attempt a few attempts later and you ll have mastered the monster s attacks and soon it ll be the one feeling the game is unfair as it squirms on the ground without it s tail as you prepare your strongest combo. What you should gather from that experience is that this game rewards quick learning. To describe it would be like bashing your head against a brick wall until something breaks it may feel unfair at first but soon you ll get the rhythm and you ll bash through that wall with ease only to find an even stronger wall behind it. This game is long. While there currently aren t too many monsters in the game each one is unique and the customizability of your gear and your character keeps you always chasing after something. However as great as this game is I do have a few gripes. Firstly there aren t that many monsters in it still and we still have to wait for the monsters from console to be ported over which they re doing at a fair pace. If you were hoping to fight any of the DLC monsters only the Pickle has been added so far. Secondly I don t really like how the slinger works with weapons. It s really annoying when another monster enters the fight and you have to put away your weapon and shoot it with dung pods until it leaves. If I could change it I d make it so you could use the slinger with all melee weapons equipped not just the sword and shield to keep the pace of the fight moving forward. Lastly I wish the grappling mechanic was used more. Maybe I played too much AOTTG when I was younger but the idea of flinging around on a grappling hook to avoid the monster seems fun to me. It doesn t have to be for all weapons if they had a new weapon which allowed that I d be happy. Speaking of the weapons the weapon variety is fantastic with 14 mechanically different weapons to choose from. Even the lance and gunlance are completely different roles despite allowing you to tank attacks with their shields and having similar movement options. All around good game and I d buy it for full price.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD,1,

1001,"2018-08-16",0,0,76,0,1,An excellent game you'll miss when you look at the awful steam review ratio.I used to really enjoy MMORPGS but since the extreme similarity between all those games in that genre i lost my interrest. But then there is Monster Hunter World finally relieving me of that MMO itch. Now you might doubt me on this one but in my opinion it combines the best of MMO's with the modern third person action combat of games like Dark Souls and Bloodborne.The game constist of only intense boss fights that can take up to 50 minutes depending on skill level. When playing the game for the first time the boss fights will feel extremely varied with each monster having their own behaviours and traits which you'll have to pick up over 10's of hours. Then after you've learned all the monster and fought them for hours on end the end game arrives. The end game consists of an heavy grind of more powerfull versions of the same monsters which will drop rare items which you can upgrade your gear with until you are the most powerfull character in the game!The game can be enjoyed as a Solo or cooperativly up until 4 players. The monsters difficulty will be scaled up depending on the amount of players which will make either solo or with 4 players feel just as challenging.Now i do want to adres why the game has such a low rating right now on steam and that is the multiplayer. Yes the multiplayer as of right now is pretty broken on peak hours and unplayable.However! Even as a truly only solo experience you can really enjoy this game for 100 hours or more easily which is way more fun then you get of your average game.Note I've played this game already 150 hours on PS4 and now another 20 hours on PC,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD,1,
1002,"2018-11-23",0,0,604,0,1,This review is written as of when I have well over 300+ hours in Monster Hunter World. Coming from the perspective of a veteran player that used to clock well over 500+ hours in Monster Hunter Freedom Unite and reached 2G/G2 I feel like there's a lot of things this game does right and better than the predecessors but it still has some minor flaws. I am not going to be covering what the game is about and such you are better off reading other reviews. I will be covering the differences between World and its predecessors.The GoodMuch easier for newer players to play because the game hand holds you more offering tutorials for weapons as well as simple hunting tipsArmor and weapon crafting has been simplified and streamlined as it is easier to tell how many upgrades are possible for all weapons. Armors strictly uses Armor Spheres (various types).The mounting and environmental mechanics makes the game feel more alive and refreshing compared to the older games. You can trigger a net drop boulders etc.Crafting during battle is way easier as you can now craft via shortcutsUsing items you now have a radial menuScoutflies is a newly introduced mechanic to World in which as the players collects tracks it is easier to spot the monsters. As opposed to the older games in which you needed to carry an item called PaintBall and had to frequently toss it onto the monster to locate it on the map and you had to do it periodically or else the tracking effect wears off.The player can now change his/her equipment and item sets in camp. This was never a thing prior to World. This means if you came into a quest unprepared you can always change your gear and add more items.New boss raid monster mechanic via Kulve Taroth and Behemoth (look into that yourself).The BadSlingers. While people may disagree with me the concept of slingers feels odd to me and some monsters such as the end game boss one will drop a significant amount of them. These are projectile items monsters will drop occasionally which players can use to shoot at monsters. Slingers also makes it extremely difficult to pick up S H I N Y items that are on the ground in World thus making it difficult to selectively pick what you want to take.The soundtrack of the game is it s weakest point in my honest opinion. As a veteran having played MHFU as well as Monster Hunter Generations Ultimate I feel like CAPCOM missed a major ball on this one by not having the music match the original MH themes. There s just something missing something maybe nearly as awesome as the music from Pokke Village. World needs more of this.Small monsters pool. This has been beaten to death but the game currently lacks diversity compared to other games due to a much significantly smaller monster pool compared to previous entries in the franchise. Weapons and armors crafting while being simplified and streamlined which is great like I mentioned above.. the weapon designs also became simplified in the worst way possible. If the player crafts a Bone weapon every upgrade or iteration of it looks exactly the same except with added fur. It s unlike the older games in which after a few upgrades the weapons goes through a massive change.Lack of a Pause feature.OverallIs the game as horrible as some veterans make it out to be? The answer is no. Could it use some improvements? Yes!!! The game will definitely bore some players like myself after a while because while updates are happening the small pool of monsters will bore a lot of people leaving them to move onto MHGU until World either updates itself and add a major expansion or players will casually hop on to check on new updates. I currently play both MHGU and World right now and I love both equally but there are some things World does that simply frustrates me with it s lazy weapon designs and horribly implemented concepts such as Slingers which you all know I hate by this point. I would rate World as a 8/10 while not a perfect game it does a lot of things right that the series needed to advance itself and cater to newer audiences. I hope you find my review helpful.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD,1,

1009,"2018-12-25",0,0,237,0,1,"As a long time fan of the Monster Hunter series (I've been following since near after the release of MH3 Ultimate in North America) I felt utterly compelled to write a review after my recent experiences with the game.This is more aimed at veteran Monster Hunter fans but I feel like there is still a lot to take away from this review as a newcomer so I'll try my best at explaining some stuff. AS A MONSTER HUNTER FAN Atmosphere / Visual direction If you're like me and have taken an extreme liking to the atmosphere and general charisma that Monster Hunter titles have historically had then you might be somewhat disappointed. I won't beat around the bush the game is a little 'grittier' than the previous titles and that's not necessarily a bad thing. But if you've grown to love the ""So tasty! "" your lances that look like sharks your dual blades that look like a fork and knife your hammers that look like blimps then I can tell you that there isn't very much of that. Capcom from what I can tell has chosen to opt out of the wackyness in favor of a more accessible familiar realistic art direction that honestly is pretty good but is certainly not what you're used to. Just be warned. However I personally think the new art direction does wonders for the monsters they've chosen to add in particular. The monsters almost look and behave like they could exist in the real world. in that regard this game is a HUGE step up from the previous titles. Not to mention the overwhelming attention Capcom has put into this game's environments. Gone are the segmented puzzle piece like maps of old. Instead each map is one great big sandbox each with it's own theme and structural style. The environments truly make this game feel like a WORLD instead of a weird stitched together mess. You have areas like Ancient Forest and Rotten Vale which are visual spectacles (even on the lowest settings) and focused on emphasizing verticality and height and you have areas like Elder's Recess and Wildspire Waste which are more focused on large open plains and craggly rocky paths that make you really feel like you're there. My point is each map is easily identifiable memorable and very distinct and unique from the rest. Not to mention extremely gorgeous in their own right. Gameplay My favourite change in the entire series has to be with the environmental interactions that Capcom has introduced in this game. Maps in the previous games were basically just a stage with props essentially just a background for where you fight. Monster Hunter WORLD however decided to really bring the idea of ""WORLD"" home. The environment is so alive there's so much to do besides killing monsters with big swords. There are lots of clever traps and goodies scattered throughout each and every map that learning a map is almost like learning the patterns of a monster. Some maps have boulder traps that let you drop a big boulder onto the monster if you position them properly. Others have vine traps that let you pin the monster down for a ton of free hits if you pay attention and play well. Are you a heavy weapon that struggles to do any aerial hits yet you long to slap monsters with a gigantic sword in the air? There are cleverly placed beetles throughout the maps that you can use your slinger on (basically a multi purpose arm attatchment every hunter now has) to launch into the air and reposition for some aerial damage. It's so rewarding and fresh compared to the previous games that honestly I can't ever see myself going back to the segmented boring map style. There is nothing like learning the ins and outs of a particular map and just absolutely decimating a monster with that knowledge. It just adds yet another layer of skilled play that is just incredibly rewarding and fun. WEAPONS. The next best thing they've done in terms of gameplay is flesh out each weapon's gameplay styles and movesets and it's honestly the direction I hope they keep going with in the future. If you've played MH before none of the weapons should feel foreign whatsoever Their core moveset is more or less identical to the previous iterations. However it feels as though this time Capcom took inspiration from the Hunter Arts / Styles (a mechanic from a previous Monster Hunter title Generations / Generations Ultimate that let you perform big flashy finishing moves or change the way a weapon is played) and simply wove those ideas into each weapon. Essentially it feels as though every weapon has a unique ""special move."" For instance Long sword now has a counter attack built into it's moveset (which was previously a ""Hunter art"") and a special ""Spirit Helm Breaker"" special move that changes how you look at your spirit gauge. Bow now has a ""Dragon Piercer"" special move that changes the way you think about how you position yourself when monsters are vulnerable (On a slight tangent the ranged weapons have been incredibly streamlined and have never been easier to get into and play). That isn't to say the weapons weren't varied in previous titles but they quite honestly feel more set apart from each other than they have been in the previous 4 games I've played. And some weapons felt woefully complicated even as a somewhat veteran player in the previous games. That is more or less completely gone in this game and I am incredibly thankful for it.So if you've played a ton of Monster Hunter before and are worried that you'll get bored of the weapons I wouldn't worry at all. Every weapon feels so good to play in this game so familiar yet new that I think you can fall in love with your favourite weapon all over again no matter how many hundreds of hours you've sunk into it. Monsters This one's kind of a big deal if you're a Monster Hunter fan like myself. I touched on the monsters a bit earlier in my visual direction section but I feel like they're such an important topic that they need a paragraph of their own.Monsters set the tone of the game. They make or break the environment. They determine the look / feel of your weapons and armor. They're what you're going to be seeing all the time seeing as you're a Monster Hunter. So they'd better be good right?I can tell you that the choice of monsters in this game is while wonderful and interesting pretty lacking as well. There are just not a lot of monsters in the game compared to previous titles and I don't feel as though they're quite varied enough in terms of body type and their fantasies. Previous titles had tons of crazy outlandish monsters that were just so unique and cool that you had to fall in love with them. Monsters like Zinogre a thunder wolf that channels lightning (he literally strikes himself with it from the sky) to charge up and essentially go full super saiyan are so fantastic and mystical which I feel is the kind of thing lacking in this particular title. Granted their choices of Elder Dragons like Teosta Kushala Daora and the brand new Elder Dragon Val Hazaak are more or less in line with the fantasy vibe I was outlining earlier. But those are Elder Dragons. They are supposed to fit this bill. But even the previous games had some engaging fantasy yet believable regular old monsters Brachydios with his explosive saliva that he coats his almost boxing glove like hands to punch and blast you with Qurupeco with the ability to mimic other monsters' cries and just call on any monster it wants. Those are just a few examples I could name off the top of my head. Bazelgeuse definitely stands out and fills this void though.I'm actually at the character limit surprisingly (I have a lot to say lol) so I'm unable to talk about the rest of the game. I think I hit the key points however. But as a fan of MH overall I cannot recommend this game enough. Please give it a try it's absolutely worth your time. Thanks for reading.",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD,1,

There are a few hiccups online being the major one but atleast for myself they are been far enough in between and I've played enough week 1 games to know that the servers being slammed is just way of life unfortuantly. Other minor bit is in the menu ui and such you can see here and there that the game has been ported where controller binds have just been mapped to keyboard. Most of the time it works but there are a few places where it could work better. The actual gameplay though is top notch and hunting with friends has never been funner. Also no hand cramps!

1027,"2018-09-13",0,0,397,0,1,"A Great follow up to the Monster Hunter series a lot of quality of life improvement since last main series that makes this one is beginner friendly simplified Armor Skill system which is make it easier to get what you want and makes a mixed set is more encouraged to use since even the skill you wanted is not maxed yet it's already active even in single armor part the skill is already useable different from previous series where you have to have at least 10 points of the skill to be active. Even when you think your armor set is already give the skills you need the addition of Decoration Slot makes your armor can be even more powerful. They switch the mechanism between decoration and charm from previous series now you farm for decoration and craft charms but for me that's understandable since a single decoration jewel can hold 1 level of skill that sometimes can improve your armor skill by a lot because some skill are only has 1 level and they're quite powerful.This game graphically is beautiful even in my kinda low end PC low resolution low texture and it's below 60 fps most of the time it is still beautiful (when you do not see it closely on purpose ofc ). And quite stable with only a little hiccup in framerate but still fully playable even when there's a lot of particle effect going on it still can hold up the frameratePlaying online is now better less disconnected and easier to connect to other session. Now it's depends on your connection 10 Mbps speed i think is the minimum to play online without lagging. So you should set your Steam Download setting to pause download when playing this game. It's kinda sad tho they remove the squad system and changed that to Steam Group system which doesn't seem to be the same system at all. I hope they gonna bring that to the PC version.One of the complain i heard from someone who's already play Monster Hunter before is MHW is kinda lacking of large monster varieties with 17 new monsters (not including unreleased monster on PC) and 14 returning monsters (including deviljho) is lacking when compared to the new released MHGU on Switch that has 93 total large monster even though it's a spin off series. But in my point of view since this World in MHW is ""New Found World"" so it's kinda natural to have fewer monster since we're still discovering about this new World but also because it's new World i was hoping they will add new monster in future update like the sub species from the new monster. From the release of MHW on PS4 and XB1 we already been ""spoiled"" about the new monster like Kulve Taroth and Behemoth from FF Collaboration (Hoping we also got this event) and returning of Lunastra. And that just it no other info about new monster. Let's hope they release sub species from the new monsters. Tho some people already make custom monster mods like Nergigante and Xeno fusion or Explosive Jagras i don't want to mod my game right now until official says it safe.TL DR Great for beginners returning player of the series can appreciate this new skill system or maybe loving it. Graphically beautiful even in low settings Server connection is already stable now and now depends on your connection to be stable with at least 10 Mbps Still lacking in variety of monsters and hoping they will add more monster returning or sub species of the new ones Addition This game is a grinding heavy so if you're not liking grinding games you should avoid it. Although you can always change the monster you hunt time to time and set goal of what you want to make so you don't get bored easily Addition Hunt with friends it much more fun that way even on losing the quest you still have fun time laughing at your team rage carting kek",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD,1,
1028,"2018-08-13",0,0,202,0,1,So Monster Hunter World very wonky launch.I've played almost all the MHs from the first one and it's been quite a journey when I heard my favourite franchise was coming to PC I've already pre ordered it in the back of my mind.Monster Hunter is an action rpg where you battle gigantic monsters with a variety of melee weapons and a few ranged ones.You do not level up but you can craft weapons and armor from the fallen monsters you carve/capture this is the only way to progress along with your personal skill and familiarity with your weapon of choice.If you're a newcomer to the series this is a challenging game but a bit easier if you compare it to other entries in the series so it's a great one to start with.Now that the intro is out of the way how does this Monster Hunter compare to the other ones?I think it's an exceptional experience the maps and areas are bigger (with no loading times inbetween!) the experience is smoother and the combat is as satisfying as ever!I would definitely recommend this to any fan of the series.I'll try to summarize the most important points.Pros + Lots of QoL improvements from crafting items to using them.+ Big maps lots to do and discover.+ Improved Graphics (ofc nothing ground breaking just better from the previous entries).+ Tracking system and scoutflies (RIP Paintballs but I like this system better).+ The ecosystem is a lot more polished with small animals different monster interaction and so on.+ Every weapon type the series ever had is here.+ Combat is improved lots of movesets feel smoother and polished also older weapons have a few new tricks.+ Palico companions are pretty neat in this one also pretty much invincible.Cons Very RNG based Decorations with the stronger ones only accessible post game. (Charms are craftable in this one at least). Somewhat less monsters (but will receive updates with more of them). No G Rank (yet but High Rank tempred monsters are fine the stronger ones can even oneshot you so yeah it's pretty much the same). Saving system (The saving in this game overwrites the file instead of creating a new one this means if you crash or turn off the game when you're saving say goodbye to your 200 hours backing up your save is very 1).All in all this feels like a very polished Monster Hunter experience it's almost like they focused more on the quality instead of quantity which means there are less overall monsters and maps.Multiplayer issues have been fixed so that's a plus.I've been having a blast solo with friends or randoms if you're interested in the game buy it I don't think you'll regret it.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD,1,
1029,"2018-08-21",0,0,213,0,0,I love the monster hunter series Ive been playing the series for 8+ years and the game its self is great but this port to PC is an insult. First off the mouse imput is terrible theres no direct input it just emulates the joystick. secondly the keyboard interactions with things such as menues and NPCs is garbage you have to do finger gymnastics to get through them. I honestly dont know what the beta phase even was because there are so many glaring issues I cant possibly imagine they thought everything was working perfectly and couldnt be improved.Theres also the matter with save file corruption after fighting xeno'jiiva or just down right disappearing save files.Neither of these are exclusive to PC either but they have gotten a lot more attention now that a section of the community that has been waiting for years has had to deal with them.Im not even going to go in to the lack of optimization. Warframe witcher 3 remember me tomb raider and numerous other games are all vastly more graphically intensive and still run with no problems on mid range computers. My computer is well above mid range and the game still runs like i have a GTX450.EDIT Ive been informed that save corruption is a result of windows missing codecs. I appreciate this but that is not the fault of the end user nor the fault of windows. It is up to the developer to have the game shipped with all software required to play it or to at least tell you you need to install specific software to run optimally.EDIT 2 Removed complaints about network issues as a fix has been put out see patch notes.Ill change my review to positive when things are fixed.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD,1,
1030,"2018-08-11",0,0,244,0,0,Fun when it works.Very poor quality console port. Multiplayer is broken most of the time.Denuvo and anti tamper eat up your CPU.

What we instead have is a poorly optimized game with virtual joystick controls horrendous networking and a poorly designed co op story mode where players have to ""watch cutscenes"" before they can join each other.

1048,"2018-08-19",0,0,327,0,1,"Note I have not played this game enough to give it a final review and playing with my laptop means I have to forgo all eye pleasing settings and opt for performance boosts as such this review may or may not be edited in the future.Feb 10th 2019 Edit 300 hours into the game and having done most of the contents they released I may be able to provide a better review that I previously did. They also fixed the connection issues and Now should be a good time to edit my review.Optimization 9/10I am currently playing on my laptop with graphic card lower than the minimum requirements (GeForce 940mx) 8 GB RAM and i5 processor. I was bracing myself for the game to run at 10 fps but it actually runs at 40 50 fps. In my opinion they did a good job at making it available to lower end PCs and laptops.Graphics 9/10The game runs smoothly on my PC and even on my lower end laptop albeit with lower graphics quality to improve on performance. There are some issues with how characters look in a few scenes (looks like the lighting and the angle is the cause) but other than that the game achieved beauty and smoothness.Soundtrack 9/10Great soundtracks that fit with the battles and situations. My favourites are the ""Tension"" soundtrack playing when Zora madga is available and the Rotten Vale battle theme really gets me pumped up!Voice acting 9/10There are quite a few choices for the language to use on the game (even Monster Hunter language) and since I am using the Japanese one I can only provide review for this particular language.The voice actors really got into their characters and brought them to life especially the commander. From strategy meetings to commanding the hunters on site I can feel the air of a veteran from him.Story 8/10The story has a good pacing that keeps me curious for more as opposed to the previous MH game I played (MHFU) where there was no real story and you just keep taking quests to rank up.They provided a background (researching the reason behind the elder crossing) and progressed the story nicely after the first mystery is solved.Grind 9/10The previous MH games felt really grindy for me where you can fight a monster 50 100 times and still not get the part you need. In this game it usually takes me around 10 15 hunts at most to get a set done and I feel that amount is just right not too grindy but not too short either.Combat 9.5/10I feel this is a part they have improved a lot since MHFU (I did not play anything after MHFU because lack of motivation).I had and still am mostly using dual swords when I play MH and they have turned them from a mediocre repeat demon dance weapon to ""I can actually dance around the battlefield with these"" weapon.The ability to reposition yourself with demon mode (and when the gauge is full normal mode too) provides the much needed survivability dual swords needed to become a decent weapon and the ""spinning captain Levi"" move is an eyegasm to watch. The dual swords were my favourite weapon set and now even more so with the rework they got.Co Op/Connectivity 6.5/10 &gt 8.5/10Thankfully the connection stability has since been improved and greatly I might add. There are still problems like not being able to connect or disconnecting from a session every now and then but it rarely happens and making a new session usually fixes it.Previous review This is an issue everyone knows and have gotten no matter how godly their internet is. No amount of nulberry can save us from the blight of connectivity errors we sometimes get. Luckily for us it is only sometimes and not all of the time although that brings us to the next issue anyway.Once someone enters your quest they take up one party member slot and that slot remains taken even after they disconnected. Nobody else can fill in that spot not even the player who disconnected. (The only way to rejoin a quest is if you start with at least 1 open slot). As if that is not enough the reward money at the end of the quest is divided by the amount of slots taken. So if you have 4 people in the quest and all 3 dced even if you continue and complete the quest solo after that your reward money will still be divided by 4.Overall 8/10 &gt 9/10 Solving the connection issues mattered that much.Previously I have been enjoying the game so far even though I mostly play in solo mode. But MH in its fullest is a co op game and the connectivity problems interrupting the co op gameplay ruins at least 40% of the fun in the game.This review is greatly affected by my experience with the previous MH titles and so is somewhat if not heavily subjective (I try to be objective though!).

It's just the right mix of Diablo/Borderlands (the loot mechanics) and a Hack 'n Slash. The port itself is OK. It's a basic Japanese to PC port.

I'm hoping they fix that issue soon because this really is a great MH game. I was antisocial and played through the whole game myself so I have no complaints about that here sorry (If you're antisociallike me and love monster hunter then absolutely buy this game.

1060,"2018-08-09",0,0,21,0,0,I am one of the few people who are not having performance problems. That being said I cant recommend this. As it stands Its a terrible console port. If youre using a controller you cant change the button mappings. The targeting is incredibly buggy and makes for very frustrating preventable deaths. The animations are reminiscent of Mass effect Andromeda. I had been looking forward to this game since its console release about half a year ago but have been utterly disappointed. Save your money and wait to see if CAPCOM addresses the issues with the game.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD,1,
1061,"2018-08-13",0,0,64,0,1,If you don't like reading long reviews then the short answer is. Just ing buy it. It's Great. Yes there are issues with the online optimization whatever. They're going to get fixed with time like any other game.I don't normally write reviews but seeing all the complaining made me feel like some people need some facts.If you like difficult games that require you to learn to improve (yeah guy who compares everything to Dark Souls but has never even experienced it's close cousin that makes it look like a steaming trash fire Bloodborne) if you like action games if you are a fan of the Monster Hunter series you will not be disappointed by this game. The combat is so goddamn smooth and the weapon playstyles so varied they have something for just about anyone. It can be a oldschool God of War style hack n' slash game with the dualblades it can be a Gears of War like 3rd person shooter with the bowguns/bow There's an axe that transforms into a sword Bloodborne style katanas with a bad jump slash move for weeaboos. There's a lance that's also a GUN. If you're into collecting a bunch of different sick looking armor sets and weapons congratulations this game is about murdering big animals and turning their corpses into sweet ing gear and then butchering their relatives with it. It is admittedly a huge time sink and a grind but the gameplay is just challenging enough to somehow make fighting the same thing 30 times engaging rather than being a chore (there are exceptions but most of the enemies are well designed). If you have a full time job and a family to take care of it might be a little harder for you to get into because of the grind. I can't really do the gameplay justice with words so go watch some gameplay on youtube and see for yourself.For veterans of the series (why haven't you bought this yet if you have disposable income/time for it) who may have reservations like I did. This is not a watered down experience. It doesn't have G rank but it's no less difficult or enjoyable because of quality of life changes. All these changes have done is removed the tedium so you can get to the meat of the game the hunting. Gathering no longer locks you in place with slow animations crafting combinations have been simplified so you don't have to spend a lifetime skinning kelbis for ancient potions you don't have to abandon a quest because your dumbass forgot to eat a meal or left your hot/cold drinks in your storage box. None of those things were good they were leftovers from the fact that Monster Hunter has basically been a modified version of a ps1 game until now. I could see how things like being able to move while firing gunner weapons or when using items could be seen with some skepticism. But with how quick and fluid the new monster's attacks are it would almost be a nightmare being stationary with the low defense gunner's have. And being able to animation cancel healing items is a double edged sword yes there's less of those 'oh moments where you get mauled to death because you popped a potion when you thought you had time but didn't but you also run the risk of wasting precious resources when you dodge 1/10 of the way through a mega potion. At it's core it is still very much the series we know and love just with some modern amenities that change up the game in a positive way. Okay so for all the people who are writing bad reviews because online issues or because you're i5 2500k nvidia 500 series 2 gb of ddr3 ram setup that you bought almost a decade ago can't run this game at max settings at 4k 60fps. DISREGARD ALL OF THESE REVIEWS. Yes there are server issues day one that's a fact. But it's not going to be forever. On it's release day it was the 7th most played game on steam at the time behind giants like DoTA 2. Yes CAPCOM has developed PC ports and ones that support online multiplayer. But the team that develops this series has never made a PC game. In fact this is the second game in the series that's multiplatform the other one being for the 3DS/Wii U. It's never been all that popular in the West despite the fact that it's a cultural phenomenon in Japan where it's produced (they literally have a ride in Universal Studios Japan dedicated to this series). It's never been on PC before. Yes they took 7 months longer than consoles to release it on PC because they wanted to make sure it worked. But they are testing the waters with this here this is completely new territory for them and they couldn't have imagined how successful it's launch was. On the release weekend just like any game the servers were overloaded and obviously not prepared. And yeah maybe textures aren't loading properly or the mouse cursor appears in the middle of the screen when you're using the controller and it's annoying. Get the outta here with that. There are always going to be issues day one with games now that's just the way it is. These issues are going to fixed with time even now on consoles there are patches/rebalances/bugfixes being released in a steady stream and PC isn't going to be any different. Eventually enough resources will be allocated to the games servers that the current disconnects are going to be a thing of the past. There is no way that Capcom won't support and fix the problems of the game that they won't even stick there corporate in because it makes them so much goddamn money. I can only think of a couple games that release free dlc content over their lifespan (Hollow Knight and Shovel Knight excellent games btw) other than monster hunter. Not just skins or anything but new monsters maps actual free ing content. And there will be fixes that come with that too. Anyone who is complaining right now calling it a disgrace or just ing is a being a child and you should ignore them. Lots of PC gamers feel they deserve something extra because they spent 3000 USD on a pre build and a 3 4k monitors but don't realize that optimizing a game for essentially thousands of different systems with different combinations of parts in them is not that realistic. Especially for a team THAT HAS NEVER MADE A ING PC GAME BEFORE.If you read through all of this thank you. I apologize for all the grammatical/spelling errors. I don't even like writing I just can't stand to see this game have mixed reviews on steam. I've only logged 20 hours so far but as a long time fan of the series I feel like it's safe to say this is the pinnacle of the series and it's going to be supported for years to come. I've waited years for this and it's everything I could ever want.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD,1,

1069,"2018-08-15",0,0,316,0,0,"TL DR This is a farce. Don't buy this crap wait for them to release a ton of patches so that you can actually play with people.Long version Technical Stuff This is so damn dumb. Capcom spewing lies about ""waiting 6 months for PC release so that it can run well""... it doesn't.The game is a bad port. No raw mouse control (just emulated joystick crap) menus and chat are just copy/pasted from console versions so nobody uses them on PC settings menu is a joke can't remove UI elements or irritating stuff (like animations for opening the quest book... that plays everytime you try to set up a quest)...The game crashes often after a few hours of play if you get an error message (you mostly won't) the error message doesn't tell you crap.You will get disconnected from sessions missions or the game often (like once every hour at least) and be stuck with a 4 player scalled monster but solo (and your reward will still be 1/4 of the normal one) lose your progress on a mission or just lose everything you did after the autosave...You can't create a group to quest together easily with your friends. You just post a quest and each player has to individually join in (if it works) before you start the quest. And they have to be in your session just being friends on steam or in game doesn't allow you to join in.And you can't really do any ""Story"" quest with your friends (can't join or be joined until you watched every annoying cutscenes from a mission). So it you want to progress together each player has to join solo the mission watch every cutscenes leave the mission one player relaunches the mission again and the others join in. Yep that's a mess.And you HAVE to do those quest to expand your ""Optional"" quest list.You can't matchmake for a mission. You can't matchmake for a boss other than using the crappy SOS system (if the player doesn't launch a SOS flare nobody out of his 16 players session can join in...)And actually joining a SOS mission crashes 1 out of 4 times with no error messages.Everything is slow too. Everytime you try to join a quest create a quest access crafting shops or any system you get annoying animations or repeating text. And everything is disseminated at the 4 corners of a big hub area. You will run around this area a lot for no other purposes than padding the gametime because you won't see any other players in here. Not even those 16 players in your session. Gameplay The game plays OK with a controller. Don't even try playing with mouse and keyboard. The mouse is just a simulated joystick so it's slow imprecise and clunky.The gameplay loop is kind of fun but because Capcom chose to hide everything being ""Progress"" be prepared to have a wiki open at all times to know what you will actually need for your next upgrade. Content Another thing where Capcom craps on PC players. All the content patches hotfixes and addons that came on console aren't here. They will probably try to sell us everything as DLC in like 4 months. Just wait for a ""Gold"" or ""GOTY"" version of this is should work fine then with all the content and even if the player base gets to be 100 times smaller than it is now you will find player quicker than with the current systems.And the story is objectivelly boring your character is a mute (doesn't even grunt when hit in cutscenes) your handler is annoying as hell and all the characters are so inconsequential that they don't even have names... Just titles (like handler captain commander ...)Again You HAVE to complete this crappy story if you want to be able to see more hunts. Conclusion Don't buy this. Wait for the updates to catch up to consoles and for Capcom to get their sh*t together and fix the broken multiplayer.If you want to play this solo it'll be a lot more boring but it should be OK.",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD,1,

This worked well for the older titles because there was an astonishing amount of variation between ranks and monsters. Not once did you go throughout a quest rank and run into the same monster twice unless you were farming it. Now it just feels...boring. There's actually no point. There is no sense of progression. It's wasting time for the sake of wasting time. And that's not a bad thing but that was never monster hunter's niche. You never picked up the DS games or the PS/PSP games and said ""I have time to spare I think I ll hunt a couple monsters..."" no you played those games to have fun. And while it is fun for the first 15 hours if you've played it and got to late game you'll quickly find out how Capcom has rigged the game to keep players playing. You see decorations are a core part of the armor system now. Armors no longer give you an overly abundant amount of skills that work in parallel to each other. You won't find gear like EX Rathalos from Generations in this game. What you will find are a series of armors that complement each other but can be improved on. Decorations can help you by adding skills otherwise unobtainable via your armor. How do you get decorations? You hunt Tempered Monsters. You need to practically suck RNJesus's because there is a small small chance you won't get what you're looking for. I have 209 hours in the game as per this review and the only good decoration I have received is one Attack Jewel. You could call that nitpicking and others would have you believe that is nitpicking but it was never this hard to obtain decorations and charms like that in the past. A couple charm farms later and you were guaranteed to find something you were looking for. Not so much the case now. I don't really feel like playing Decoration lottery when the fun factor of the game should be on the actual monster fights themselves.Don't even bother making a full set because aside from two armor sets it's not even worth it. Mixed sets are the meta now. If you're caught dead with a full set at HR100+ chances are you've gone about the game wrong or you didn't get the memo. In previous games mixed sets were harder to make but the payoff was amazing. Since individual skills were tied to point values rather than outright being fixed to a piece of gear it meant that finding what you wanted was harder but the payoff if done correctly had you rocking skills like Focus 3 Attack up XL Crit Draw Sharpening Destroyer Critical Eye Fencing etc. All of those and MORE potentially on ONE set of armor. Now if you are truly blessed by RNG and have the right decorations you can get maybe about 3 or 4 of those on one set swapping out armor pieces as you see fit. But you'll mostly be using already existing armor pieces to get HALF of those to acceptable levels before you gem in the rest of your skills to get them all to max rank. Tempered Monsters is this game's version of an artificial hard mode and your main way of farming these decorations. They don't have any outstanding features from their normal variants except that they hit harder and have higher HP values. This wouldn't be a problem if they were optional and didn't have any significance to them. Ohh but they do. And Capcom knows this. They locked the highest rewarding jewels behind the highest rank of tempered monsters. It's like they knew somewhere down the 4 year development cycle of this game there wasn't going to be enough content to supplement the game. Players were going to leave after beating the game. And most of them did. It's because of this the idea for tempered monsters came about. Artificial Difficulty the concept that drove DarkSouls 2 into the ground. Because now things hit harder and if you get hit you aren't skilled and should uninstall. Gee isn't this fun? Fighting the same thing you've fought for the past 50 hours again only this time it hits harder? Wow what an innovation. /s(This brings up Apex and Hyper monsters but there were actual differences with those monsters compared to """"""tempered"""""" monsters. Apex monsters applied a debuff to and you had to use a special tool called a wyestone to knock them out of their state. In order to get rid of the debuff you had to constantly attack the monster. You do this enough and you get an affinity boost and a resistance to the Apex's Frenzy Virus. Apex monsters were also naturally large so they were easier to farm gold crowns. Hyper monsters were monsters affected by some weird phenomenon making them as their name suggests hyper aggressive. Their speed animation values and damage values all changed making them feel a little different from their normal counterparts. On top of that they weren't easily exhausted meaning they would press the attack more often. They were difficult but fun. They had SIGNIFICANT changes that differed from their NORMAL counterparts and they had UNIQUE and INTERESTING mechanics behind those SPECIFIC fights.)What was i getting at just now? Well as I ve stated earlier. The only thing changed about Tempered monsters are their Damage and HP values something a braindead chimp could do in notepad+. Yeah sure they have a fresh coat of ""paint"". That being a lazy effects brush plastered over their texture but they pale far in comparison to games of old's interpretations of an alternate monster.Base game monster difficulty is a joke. As soon as your HR unlocks you're already at the point where Hunts starting taking less and less time to complete. Your newbie hunts that once took 20 30 minutes and felt like an actual hunt now feel mundane as you begrudgingly swat down a Tobi'Kadachi for one part for the 50th time in the span of 3 minutes. The hunts in previous titles always felt like hunts. Occasionally the monster would run forcing you to travel to new areas of the map and along the way you may find yourself suddenly staring down the eyes of a Deviljho that had just entered the area. Now monsters let you hit them for the good part of 5 minutes before realizing that your are in fact a threat and hightail it out of there to eat sleep or relocate. Sometimes they don't even get to sleep because you kill them so fast. Even the tempered monsters drop like flies.It's really sad that I'm writing this review in a negative manner because i really wanted to enjoy this game as much as my friends do or *think* they do. The game's popularity is slowly declining. Capcom has taken note of this and offered up Tempered ing Zora'Magdaros and Tempered Blue Teostra in an attempt to lure players back into the grind. I'm betting the fight isn't even remotely different... And if it is props to them but I m not going to waste my time playing this game if all it has to offer are rebranded monsters. I really hope the series doesn't stick to this formula. It's not good. It's just meh.",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD,1,

Multiplayer often kicks you out (probably due to the mass amount of players) Some people get graphic errors (not me at least)* No ultrawide support this is a big downer for me but it won't stop me from recommending!* Oh noes... You can't get 144 fps ultra 4k... Awell... Should've known the hardware these days can't manage 4k on most games unless low settings beforehand.Overall I'm hoping for some bug fixes and a community patch for ultrawide maybe some mods too. However this is a much better experience than on console due to instant loading and smooth fps.

Once you overcome the technical difficulties you are presented with a very impersonal multiplayer which doesnt encourage communication. There is no lobby as in the 3ds games where you can say hi to your team and decide on which quest you want to go together. During the quest i have never seen anyone saying anything to each other besides the automatic messages or the thumbs up stickers and ""Great job""s after the hunt. After the quest the teams always break up and you need to look for other teammates.

1109,"2018-08-18",0,0,90,0,0,"I've played just shy of 70 hours of this game. It was my first Monster Hunter. I'm told it's the easiest to approach in the serise from a beginners perspective. The only response I have to that is ""then why has anyone ever put up with this serise?""I'm writing this drunk and disapointed as heck and I'm too emotionally drained to fully flesh out and articulate every single thing I hate about this game suffice it to say at least 1 hour of my time for every 3 hours of gameplay has been me pontificating towards my friends about all the awful clashing game mechanics this miserable piece of work has.It's not that it's 'hard'. It's that it's unfair. It's that the game mechanics aren't taught well. It's that many elements of it just don't mesh well together. I waited what? Half a year for this to come out after the console launch? I was so excited for my first chance to try a Monster Hunter game. I gave it so much time to try to get into it but I still just can't stop finding things to hate about it.I'm not going to say it's totally devoid of merrit. There were elements I enjoyed and that drew me in. I liked the hunting aspect the gathering of supplies and stuff. I sometimes would just follow a Toby Kadachi around the ancient forest until it wound up at it's nest and fell asleep. For some reason that exploration drew me in more than any amount of the abysmal story or infuriating combat.And don't get me started on how bad this port is.All and all I'm really really disapointed. If I hadn't bought this as a key from Green Man Gaming I'd have refunded it ages ago. I hit a particularly low point and wanted to vent my frustrations so here it is.

1114,"2018-08-19",0,0,218,0,1,"I have a GTX 1060 and an i7 8700. Game runs like butter even with a full party using elemental weapons.TL DRThe game is very well made with beautiful design in most categories (Combat World Character Armor Weapon) more than 100 hours of content and tons of replayability. But the online needs some work because there are server issues. I would get the game if you aren't using wifi. I think I had a total of 5 disconnects when playing with friends and I have a ton of hours on this game. Controls can also be improved. Definitely worth $60.I'm not going to seperate the pros and cons since they are kinda intertwined.The soundtrack game design and combat are fantastic. There is hidden content the game doesn't really tell you about. IE Cat villages that give you different tools for your Palico (humanoid cat) bounties and investigations that give you extra bonuses from hunting monsters. Most of the different items you can use aren't well explained so newbies to the series might not use them at all. Using the training area is HIGHLY 1. Each weapon has different mechanics. Even something like a bow has combos and different skills. The game world feels alive with monsters interacting with each other and the evironment around them. There are even turf wars between some monsters. You can use the environment to your advantage when fighting monsters. Making them run into trees dropping boulders on them kicking frogs (you'll understand if you play) etc. You can even break different parts of the monster (break their horns cut off their tail crack their nails shred up their wings etc.).Once you get High End the difficulty increases by a lot more monsters are introduced and more game mechanics are introduced as well. Low End is more for an introduction to the game and world. Getting to High End takes about 20 30 hours.I don't really know too much about the voice sync problems since I always listen to games in the language they were made in and the japanese sync is passable.Compared to other MH titles the game is a lot more streamlined. Geared towards making grinding less tedious and trying to expand it's fan base. You can take this as a con or a pro depending on how big a fan you are of MH. This is a game where you are meant to grind monsters and take your time exploring. It isn't something you are supposed to sprint through at a break neck pace. If you try you will end up wasting tens of hours backtracking because you'll soon find enemies can one shot you and your weapons aren't doing a lot of damage. If you aren't into that don't get the game.However there's something satisfying about getting stomped by a monster grinding for 2 hours then obliterating them for revenge. Then putting them in an arena only to wreck them again with a dragonator.You're also meant to explore the different weapon types. If you try to focus on one weapon type a monster will come along to render it useless. NEVER play with randoms NEVER use SOS. That's probably the reason why there aren't a lot of public servers open. Most are cancer. They join then leave causing you to solo a monster meant for 3 4 people.There are connection issues but they will be fixed. When it comes to making an online game you can run all the tests you want but having servers support hundreds of thousands at once for the first time without bugs is near impossible.I played the game through with a few friends and yes let me tell you. The game is fun alone but it is a blast with friends. Enemies are more difficult and you can use different strategies to take down different monsters.As for the controls. I use mouse and keyboard but it can be difficult if you don't have very good hand eye coordination. The UI for item usage is the best out of any MH game but I can see why people are complaining about it. It requires you to press multiple buttons to switch items (Hold ""Q"" while mouse scrolling or left and right clicking). I have a gaming mouse so I can just map the stuff. Not really an issue for me.Comboing with the different weapons requires you to use Left CTRL and Left and Right Mouse buttons. TheI don't use the lock on at all. It takes away a lot of the camera freedom and can switch to different body parts if you move the camera the wrong way. Free handing it is far better more me and I don't have the same problems with acceleration like the other people. Maybe I'm used to it or the problem is insignificant.I play the game a lot so if you think I have bias feel free to try and call me out on it. I'll try and respond to everyone that disagrees.Finally and most important. Use an ethernet cable and download the new GEFORCE Driver for MH and your game issues will decrease significantly.",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD,1,

I had no idea what was good what was bad which did what and you end up being very dazed.As it stands the game is not worth 60 and it feels that it was a rushed job to get it out on the PC market. It definitely needs a lot of polishing and optimization before I would even consider paying half of that for a game that only gave me headaches and frustration.If I have to say something positive the combat was very fun and was probably the least problematic part of the game.

Less of an issue with friends (Discord TS etc.) but annoying when playing with randos.Another major detractor from the game is that you cannot start a story mission in co op unless everyone's already seen the intro cutscene.

1143,"2018-08-09",1,3,4,0,0,"I purchased this game to play Co op with a group of friends online. That being said this has to be the worst attempt at online multiplayer I've ever seen. The invite by steam system throws in game messages to tell you where to go to join a friend's session only to fail when you get there. Once you finally manage to wiggle youself into a friend's ""session"" and even manage to see each other in the gathering area you won't be able to join friend(s) on a quest. You can see a friend's quest and a red message saying you can not join. We managed to play together one time using an SOS flare and joining on the expedition only for the server to kick us out of eachother's session during the monster fight.For those wanting this for Co op questing with friends stay away. Whoever designed the input keys for the menu system and UI was just throwing darts at a keyboard. While blindfolded. The character aiming isn't attached to your mouse and instead shoots towards where you aim them with WASD. The cut scenes are unskippable and plenty.WARNING(The cut scenes and initial set up run longer than the Steam return policy.)",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD,1,

It's literally day one and people can't get over themselves. I hardly notice it if at all. And if there is? It will no doubt get fixed.This game is so fun and is just amazing. Please buy it.

1147,"2018-08-18",0,0,115,0,0,Maybe in a year I will be able to make my first full hunter build. Very repetitive and grindy. If don't want to keep doing the same thing over and over again for a 3% change of that gem to make the next tier of your weapons don't get the game. Even worse if you need it from a boss fight you can only access a few random times.I have a EVGA 1080ti with a 6700K 4.4ghz and my FPS can drop into the 20s for some boss fights. Other times it runs fine around 90 100 at 1440p resolution. Besides that the game does look good except for some textures look like they came from a N64 game. The online portion is a hit or miss. Sometimes I can play with friends and other times I'll be soloing a 4 person elder dragon. Controls are awful and makes it so you have to use a controller. Using a mouse makes it feel like I'm using a joystick. I can't aim properly with it no free range. The keybinding must have been created by a blind person randomly pressing down on the keyboard. V for ADS basically... The mechanics of the game are good though. Every weapon has it own playstlye. They all act different and each has its own weakness and strength. The Food system works well depending on the fight doing your own platter is better than the chef's special. The game does feel balanced when it comes to fights and weapons. There is no power house class like some otehr games. Hopefully they will import the terrible feel of this on PC and maybe make casual players be able to enjoy this without making them dump many hours to playing this.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD,1,

What's worse is that even if you are able to reconnect online you will experience long hours of not be able to search nor attend any quest.

I am hoping that they will make the servers more stable with more patches a sthey stated as well as fix a few graphical issues with the port. But gameplay wise this is a true master piece!Please dont let the support die down of this game and hopefully the negative reviews will be turning into positive reviews after this multiplayer patch. Another problem some have described is the curroption of the save game after a certain boss. This is proven to be 0. The problem was a misisng video codec.

1159,"2018-08-09",0,0,324,0,1,"Having bought a PS4 just to play this game in January I love this game and this series. I will mention first that I am very very early in my PC/Steam review so don't make a final decision based ONLY on my review. I'm here to say my first impression while its fresh. I'll start with the bad before leading to the good.I have a really good PC setup GPU is a EVGA Nvidia Geforce 1080TI SC2 (11GB VRAM) CPU is an Intel i7 7700K (4.2 GHz) and 16 GB of DDR4 RAM. Despite my specs I've noticed that non cinematic scenes dip in frames when I play 4K and max settings. I'm fairly confident that its not so much my specs handling the load of my settings but rather how the game uses CPU memory. I don't know how to give specific details I'll just offer a personal opinion on the matter Its not game breaking at all. I kept my eye specifically out to see if it was as doomsday as some media reported.The only thing else worth pointing out something that's much more critical is that default mouse and keyboard controls are a bit wonky. Combat specifically isn't that bad its actually more navigating menus and accessing your item bar thats awkward to say the least. Everything more or less has to be confirmed with a left mouse click and to exit anything/go back you have to RIGHT CLICK. ESC doesn't apply all the time and the most bizarre function I accidentally prompted was accessing a load/save your loadout menu while trying to equip my first weapon and once I accessed that menu accidentally ESC turned into a ""Rename your loadout"" button. Right clicking was the exit/go back function. I don't see that as practical. Also right clicking is your action button too. Picking up recources accessing item/equipment boxes that's your button. Meanwhile E is to use your selected item and holding Q brings up your item bar that you have to navigate with mouse buttons HOWEVER to switch item shortcut menus you have to use arrow keys. That's pretty freaking hard to do while your mouse has to both navigate your camera your attack moves and your action button. I should never have to take my hand off my mouse to navigate anything.Aside from these complaints the game is as much as I remember it feeling like when I play it on PS4. The content of the game delivered me over 400 hours of playtime without friends who play. For all my complaints there's 10 more praises. Play the game play with friends watch tutorials find guides on armor and weapon sets and explore one of the most engaging communities in this industry!",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD,1,

Unfortunately after this 3 hours you will request refund then you will figure out that is not possible beacuse you have played more than 2 hours but most part of this was watching cinematics doing the tutorial and reading dialogue that you cant skip.

You may lose connection from time to time and hell even a crash or two here or there. Guess what the game autosaves so unless its a serious bug you wont lose anything from a crash and the load times are so fast that disconnects can be fixed in seconds by simply rejoining or backing out and reforming the quest which is incredibly easy to do. I have over 100 hours on this game already and for anyone looking for a fun RPG game that can be enjoyed solo or with friends this is the game for you. It has a fun grind and rewarding combat. Nothing feels better than landing your big combo and sending the monster reeling back from the hit. So if you wanna and moan and ruin a good games rating on here because of some issues that have NOTHING to do with the gameplay and EVERYTHING to do with the servers go ahead.

1181,"2018-08-11",0,0,163,0,1,Issues are certainly existent in this game ranging from bugs to minor features in the game that were either uncalled for or non logical or simply hateful such as a certain npc. But does that make this a bad game? No.There is a nice story present. I am new to the franchise so having a simple story that builds up in a very minimal grind rpg makes it enjoyable for me. The gameplay is pretty good but repetitive. It all comes down to go kill return. There are variations present though such as mission types and ways to destroy your enemies those in combination with multiplayer makes it a nice experience. I'd personally love if there were classes rather than weapon based skill trees but I can't complain. It works well.Since this game wasn't originally english the lip sync is out of the place but other than that it is quite an enjoyable journey in a beautiful world with devastating creatures where you will use the multiplayer functionality more than you will consider to play solo. The only big downside is that you can't skip cutscenes and that multiplayer is disabled until you've watched all cutscenes per mission. There is no disable feature for this.All game breaking bugs have work arounds available. Do note that due to Denovu older gen cpu's aren't supported though. I like the game it isn't like a superb perfect 10/10 kind of game but it is a refreshing not mainstream type of game. I'd honestly give it 72 points out of a full 100. It has a lot content so you will have plenty to do whether it is worth the price is honestly debatable. I think it is.Edit Do note that if this game was actually terrible it would be flooded with negative in depth reviews about the gameplay and wouldn't have such a high number of concurrent players for the first week. The voices of the people that hate it are only heard most that enjoy the game rather spend more hours into it than writing reviews. Don't let the numbers of the review influence your choice. A lot (not all) negatives are simply about the game not having 21 9 support or that the latest drivers don't support it (yet). Watching a walkthrough of the first boss should give you a general idea about the gameplay in a minimal way. You can search for more of course if you enjoy getting spoilers.Edit 2 Reaching the 100 hour mark I can say that eventually the bosses become fairly easy. But do mind that this is after you've spend countless hours of joy. I have had AAA games where things were boring already after 5 hours. So it is good that endgame things are getting fairly easy as it feels rewarding since you as a player progressed a lot in order to reach that point. If you are into this kind of games and are new to the franchise you will easily get 100+ hours into this. If you are a veteran to the franchise then the bosses might be a little underwhelming. Also do note that updates get released to tackle existing issues. For other issues some mods happen to fix loads of things other than that I think it is still good for another couple of 10s 100s of hours for me.Specs and stats At 1080p (high settings preset) I get a constant 60 fps. Can be 80+ if I disabled the cap but I'd rather have a stable fps. These were the stats during a boss fight.Cpu i7 4790k 4.5ghz average of 62% loadRam 32gb ddr3 average of 2.6gb usedGpu gtx 980ti average of 87% used,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD,1,

1195,"2018-08-22",0,0,230,0,1,Recommend MaybePlayed MH4U MHGen and MHXX (IG/LBG)Comparing to the old games so far it's been pretty good. Storyline is as good as 4U much better than Gen/XX! There's been some changes like Mega Dash Juice not present and armour skills palico and effect system but overall the changes aren't so bad. I think it's actually easier now to make better armour sets and skills. New monsters are interesting to fight and it's nice they kept some old ones. The new pet and room upgrade is cool too feels more like a 'world'. Hoping they bring back some 4U and Gen like Glavenus and the Magalas. They took out the Hunter Arts from Gen/XX but it's not so bad since attack combos seem a bit more buffed (i.e Aerial art is now included in the Insect Glaive I think). The new LBG is weird to play so not sure how I feel about that. Glaive options has been slightly nerfed doesn't seem like there are as many choices for some ailments. The apperance of the IG doesn't seem to deviate much so appearance wise it's a bit lacking compared to some of the beautiful glaives in 4U ( Also if you've played 4U/Gen/XX sometimes it's easy to figure out an attack pattern because of how some similar they are to previous monsters. There are some new attack patterns present so it's not a huge issue. However they really simplified the game. There's no paint ball there's no waving to the ship no micromanaging Palicoes. No mini games now for sending Palicoes to gather things. Auto crafting is nice but I've never used it since it wastes materials. The Argosy is a cool new feature but I feel like I'm using it to just make more cash. It feels like it's spoon feeding you some aspects of the game. To me it feels like this game has been easier so far than 4U and Gen. In some ways that's good for sanity but also feels like a half authentic experience. Hopefully in future DLCs G Rank will be implemented. Using controller and so far it feels like a 3DS/Switch experience. Sometimes the right trigger (on a Dualshock) doesn't work so alt tabbing or pressing Steam home button and going to controller will fix it but it's definitely going to be annoying for weapons that need the trigger/pods. There are some issues 1. Multiplayer Keeps disconnecting even with some 'fixes' like making your own session before joining a friends. It's really annoying when you're trying to hunt together. Sometimes it's you sometimes it's your friend and this is really big when you're helping with story or trying to hunt for parts together since the monster's multiplier is still there even after disconnection. Friend invites kind of work kind of don't. Definitely need to fix this because it's infuriating. There's a disconnection every hour and sometimes every time we start a quest. 2. The new Radical Menu It's a good implement from the new system but for some reason it won't save even after changing items and keeps defaulting to a really old 'saved' version. 3. Alt tabbing crashes the game sometimes. Game can also alt tab on it's own for no reason and then alt tab back in. If you're hunting with friends the Discord overlay is a life saver if you don't disconnect first... Overall Multiplayer is super infuriating and upsetting but the story and play is good.

1196,"2018-08-12",0,0,235,0,1,I get why people are giving these reviews I don't say the don't deserve it because they took a lot of extra time just to do the port and some people with very good rigs can't run it at 60fps and yeah it is a bad port or at least it should be better considering what I just sayed they took 8 months just to do the port and they are the ING Capcom so yes it should be a perfect port and it isn't BUT... if you are one of the lucky people that run it smoothly (for whatever reason) you are gonna love this game and that i'm sure as i bought it 24h ago and I alredy have 30. Besides that gameplay atmosphere monsters are awesome and you have plenty of good and cool weapons i mean even grinding is fun so... yeah buy it with this amount of people i'm sure they are gonna fix the port eventually and when that happens i'm sure this game will be one of those few ''overwhelming positive'' games on steam.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD,1,

1200,"2018-08-11",0,0,102,0,1,Review at Patch Launch PatchHours Clocked 23.8Disclaimer My first entry into the Monster Hunter Series and played mostly solo by choice.Ridiculous sized monsters insane weapons and an adorable companion seems like a pretty solid introduction to Monster Hunter. I had first heard of the series a long time ago but never had the opportunity to try it out. When I heard about the series again I was playing a Beta for Dauntless. With Dauntless being my first exposure the Monster Hunting Formula I was completely blown away with Monster Hunter World from the beginning. For the uninitiated you are a Monster Hunter and the monsters you hunt are massive creatures. These monsters require skill to track fight and take down. Each and every fight can be a fight for your very life.As you track the creature you can gather materials for crafting fish and capture small creatures but beware your hunt mark is not the only beast in the area. Other monsters roam the land some are not dangerous to you while some are deadly and will even fight your mark for territory.You'll of course be aided by a friendly Palico a cat companion that can offer various means of assistance. Initially this comes in the form of healing and some light damage. You can equip your Palico with better gear and different gadgets to suit your hunt.Speaking of gear most of the materials you use to craft new armor will be obtained through your hunts. This means to get much of the gear you need to hunt tougher monsters will be by killing other monsters for stats that will offer better resistances skills and to better exploit your chosen mark's weaknesses.The fights themselves can range wildly in approach depending on your weapon and fighting style is. With 16 weapon types and traps at your disposal there is a lot of options to suit your desire. I personally swapped between Hammer and a Bow which offered were dramatically different even when fighting the same monster.While I got to the 4th zone solo I did foray into Multiplayer to answer a SOS Flare. This flare is something a player can use to call reinforcements to help if you are feeling a little outclassed. You can opt to form a party for more persistent experience as SOS Flares are drop in drop out. I personally did not play the more persistent multiplayer portion.Overall recommendation is that I recommend Monster Hunter World.The Good Every Monster feels unique. Palicos. There is lots to see and do so grinding materials is not so bad because you can do other things at the same time.The Bad Multiplayer can be hit or miss but haven't had any issues with the missions I have run so far. Until you get a feel for a weapon difficulty can swing wildly. While unaffected in singleplayer there were some disconnections to the server.The Ugly Nothing glaringly wrong here as I've finished the first 3 zones solo but some people that want to avoid MP might find fights too hard to solo. I'm on the 4th zone and fights are tough but not impossible to solo so far.System Specs CPU Intel(R) Core(TM) i7 4790K Processor 4.40GHz CPU Cooler Corsair H100i GPU GeForce GTX 970 G1 Gaming Memory Corsair Vengeance 32GB OS Windows 10 Pro,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD,1,

1209,"2018-08-12",1,3,91,0,1,"I'm splitting this into 2 sections 1 for the game itself and 1 for the quality of the port. This is a review from a first time Monster Hunter. Long time fans should look elsewhere for a review. tl dr Love the game port has issues if your PC meets requirements get it anyway it's too funEdit 1 Locked the game at 60 used Radeon settings to override game settings and it's much more stable. (60 frames nearly all the time) Enabled some filters not very high but you can notice less jaggedness with no performance loss and far less stuttering.1) The Game Monster Hunter World is incredibly fun. The monsters themselves are interesting visually and the environments are beautiful in their own right. There are a multitude of weapons to choose from and they all have a unique play style. If you prefer faster weapons there are dual swords or sword and shield and if you prefer a big hammer or great sword they've got you covered as well. Try them all out and see which one clicks for you. This game is deliberately slow and methodical. You can't just spam the attack button over and over again until you win. You need to recognize what attack the monster is doing and either sprint or dodge roll out of the way. The game isn't ""clunky"" like some people might say it just doesn't reward mindless mashing at least not later into the game. The main thing that might completely turn you off about Monster Hunter is that it is a VERY grindy game. You will be hunting monsters over and over again for parts to craft armor and weapons. That's the foundation of the game. If you don't like grinding regardless of whether or not the fight is fun then you won't enjoy Monster Hunter. I can enjoy a bit of a grind especially when there's so many big monsters to fight.2) The Port OK so here's a touchy subject. The port is NOT great. It's absolutely not the worst and I wouldn't even say it's bad it's just not above average. The development team clearly needed/needs more time to fine tune things. This is their first attempt at a PC version and it shows. Some features are missing like control over motion blur and depth of field. The game's looks don't reflect how it runs. I'm only playing at 1080p with a mix of med/high settings (mostly medium) with some things just turned off completely like filters and volume rendering (obviously) and I get drops to mid 40s (once into the 30s) in some situations. There is such a wide swing in performance. One minute I'll be running through Ancient forest framerate anywhere from 60s to 80s (smooth) and the next an Anjanath will be charging in to fight attack my palico and the game jolts down to 45 instantly before recovering. I get that this is Monster Hunter's first proper appearance on PC as well as home consoles in a long time and that it's still better than it's ever been performance wise but that doesn't excuse how unpolished parts of this port are. I really hope the dev team (and Nvidia and AMD with future drivers) can continue to improve things because this game is ridiculously fun I think I may even love Monster Hunter but this isn't the port this game deserves. It deserves better and it's a disservice to this game to just be ""fine"" with how it is. The thing is even with how wonky the port is I still recommend it. It's just too fun not to recommend. If you have a PC that can run it (I have a Ryzen 1700x and RX 480) then give it a shot if it appeals to you.",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD,1,

Planning to squeeze out of this baby at least twice as much.Thank you for this great great game Capcom. Easily one of my most favorite games of all times.Never in my life i enjoyed a grindfest as much i enjoy it with this game.Buy it. You won't regret it.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD,1,
1215,"2018-08-09",0,0,118,0,0,The majority of complaints (about the game itself) I hear from people are that the game has too little content they compare World an HR game to things like 4U 3U XX all G rank games with tons of previous games and assets to draw off of that isn't the problem in fact it's to be expected from a leap this big in terms of graphics and such like Tri was but what was not expected was the massive simplification and even removal of core gameplay features that made the series what it was and I don't really hear many people talking about that.Monster Hunter World is a heavily casualized and simplified entry into the Monster Hunter series. It gives the player way too much and the monsters way too little it even takes some away from the monsters turning a game where you have to plan moves accordingly and where all your actions have consequences into an almost brainless action game. It all stems from World's elimination of dedication to your actions that has previously been a staple of the series.As far as the port s quality goes I ve heard mixed to bad things. Personally I m not able to max the game out at 1440p 144hz on a 1080ti and 4790k in fact I get about 70fps in Ancient Forest with things like fog and AA turned off and the framerate dips down into the 50s during fights this is pretty disappointing when things like the new Prey Doom FFXV etc. run at full resolution and framerate with pretty much everything maxed but this game with no extra graphics and fluff above the console versions can t something s wonky the game s obviously not very well optimized but hopefully they can fix that with some patches. The first patch fixed network issues a bit but disconnects still happen at times. The KT one did a bit more but connections are back on the frits again. On top of all that Capcom is deciding to withhold already finished content to artificially extend the game's lifespan very anti consumer.Below is a list of general things that I dislike about the game compared to previous entries and why I dislike them in no particular order. Moving while healing lets you literally run circles around monsters while healing up and avoiding damage where before you had to go through the entire animation standing still this takes away a huge part of dedication to actions that the series was known and makes dying almost impossible unless you get stunned or 1 hit. Monsters have been downgraded in terms of AI movement speed and damage compared to previous HR games making a game where hunters are already insanely powerful more one sided. Armor has been changed from both melee specific and ranged specific sets to just one type eliminating the weapon style specific differences (ranged armors having heavily armored left sides) and forcing ranged or melee skills onto an armor set that have no need for them which brings me to Armor skills are insanely overpowered and bloated you only need a single point to activate them instead of working up to a +10 or 15 there are no longer negative skills to help balance out positive ones and your average unoptimized late game HR armor set in World has as many if not more powerful armor skills than an extremely optimized G rank set in previous games. Organic game elements were replaced with UI elements in previous games in order to figure out how much damage you were doing you would see how much blood came flying out a monster when you hit it big blood splash was big damage small blood was small damage in World that blood is replaced with numbers and pebbles that fly out of the monster and don t vary at all with damage. Previously you had to watch for a monster s health by how many parts you had broken on it and when it got low enough the monster would limp back to its nest in World you have a health bar in the form of a heartbeat tracker that tells you exactly when a monster is in a limping or capture state without having to observe it at all. Scoutflies are another big one related to the above paintballs were in place before to track monsters that went around the map but you had to find the monsters first and there was no way to know beforehand where they would be. In World there s a footprint and track system in place that tells you where a monster is and is going but on top of that the game shoves these camera obstructing Skyrim flies everywhere that fill up your screen make your camera fly in different places and are just an all around nuisance. The game has a system in place to let you organically find the monsters without UI elements telling you where to go and babying you but instead it forces scoutflies in your face with no way to turn them off or not take them along. You can no longer pause the game even in single player mode. Your item pouch is absolutely massive in World you have separate pouches for monster materials usable/crafting items and ammo this almost completely eliminates item management that previous games had you would have to compromise bringing tools and traps on hunts and having enough space for loot. Item recipes are heavily simplified you only need 2 herbs to craft a potion for example where before you needed an herb and a blue mushroom most craftable items are now like this. The above combined with 100% success rate on all item crafting makes in fight crafting trivial where before you had a failure chance to craft something unless you had a book for it which took up an inventory space in hunt you now can freely take enough materials to make 9 extra flash bombs a boatload of extra ammo etc. Most weapons have been given some sort of counter or get out of jail free move GS gets to cancel out of charges with superarmor LS gets a spammable counter IG gets airdashes Bowguns get to move while shooting etc. Bowguns moving while shooting breaks an already extremely broken weapon in the case of LBG you can literally circlestrafe around monsters while you kill them Mantles are absurdly broken with a rocksteady and health booster you can stand still and whack a monster to death with no consequence with temporal you have an effective 90 seconds of total invulnerability and more. The Town Astera has a terrible layout with everything very spread out and no way to get from one end to the other in a quick way the closest rope chain to the entrance of town in about 10 seconds away while there are multiple other travel spots within seconds of each other. There is a huge amount of paid DLC and microtransactions in the game never before has a game in the series actually charged for something like emotes character change tickets cosmetic armor etc. Areas are huge and can be confusing in the case of Forest chasing down the monster takes a lot longer than in previous games to the point where hunts can be 50% chasing Monsters tend to fight each other just as much as they fight you where before they would focus you down almost always that and the new turf wars make multi monster fights almost always in your favor Village and Guild quests were combined into one questline making for less content and less options for difficulty This is more subjective but the weapons armors music and overall aesthetics of the game have been heavily muted and westernized and are less varied Due to all of this (and more steam doesn't like it when reviews are too long) the only way to make the game difficult is to have monsters that spam AOE attacks everywhere like madmen and that s what they ve done with a lot of the post release monsters on consoles Lunastra Behemoth the AT elders all have extremely spammy AOE moves that just feel unfun to fightMonster Hunter World is an insult to the Monster Hunter name I ve been a fan of the series since 2nd generation and have imported every game since but if the series continues like this I don t think I can consider myself a fan for much longer.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD,1,
1216,"2018-09-22",176,523,511,0,0,"Capcom manager why are we receiving bad reviews?Capcom staff well let's see.we made PC players wait 8 months to play the game. Then we released it without the dlc updates available on consoles not to mention the servers and terrible optimization.Capcom manager no problem I have a plan to fix this. Let's use the money from PC sales to make events exclusive to consoles.Capcom staff FACEPALMSEDIT Seems like a few fanyboys have misunderstood the context of my review.So to avoid any further misunderstandings let me explain why I've given it a DO NOT recommend.Firstly let me say that i am a big fan of the game and the series and it's not my first monster hunter game but i'm not going to ignore some of the issues I faced during my 300 hour playtime.If you played the game at launch then you will be familiar with the error code 50382 MW1. Want to play with a friend? sorry get disconnected.Want to help a someone through SOS?nope sorry MW1 incoming want to play alone? guess what? it's your buddy 50382 MW1.Such a big issue should've been fixed within the first week itself but it took Capcom 3 4 weeks to patch this.This is the main reason why the game has lot of negetive reviews.That said they HAVE FIXED the issue and there's no complaints on my side regarding server issues anymore. So if you're considerding not buying the game cause of server issues then let me tell you they HAVE BEEN resolved.On the same note you can ignore the reviews complainting about mouse issues as well.They HAVE also been RESOLVED.So if you like the base game(killing the sht out of monsters) and were on the fence of buying cause of these 2 issues.Then you can safely jump over the damn fence and get game already cause the issues have been resolved.So why did i give this game a thumbs down??Here are my reasons1.can't join quest until host has watched cutscene(WTF??)2.Horrible keyboard+mouse optimization.3.Graphics performance. It's looks worse than Witcher3 and yet does not run as well as the Witcher3 which was a 2015 game btw.4.Events and updates not included. There is no reason why they shouldn't have included all the patches of consoles in the PC version upon release.I don't believe that the developers should go without criticism when they take 7 months to ""optimize"" a game and yet release it with such glaring issues.If no one complainted about the servers then we probably wouldn't have got a patch in 3 weeks(which itself is a long time).Similary I believe if no one complaints about the events and additional content they are going to take longer than we hope to see new content being released.Once we start catching up to the consoles.I will change my review to 1.",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD,1,

Let's just hope the devs will sort this problem out sooner than later.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD,1,
1218,"2018-08-14",0,0,76,0,1,Its rare for me to review a game but when I noticed the average reviews as mixed and given I had played this on the PS4 and PC. I felt I needed to say something. This game is not perfect no game is Capcom had some problems implementing their servers but the core game hunting monsters and crafting gear is right up there with Dark Souls. The game has an enormous number of things to do and they have regular events that make it fun to take part in the game combined with free updates and free new monsters I can say its a good game for the long haul. I read some people have a beef with them selling emotes for real money. Really? Dont buy them. Its hard enough to do an emote anyway in the hundreds of hours ive played this game collectively ive used emotes 3 times. The first time I took down Nergigante with a friend the first time I took Xeno'jiva with a friend and when i was showcasing something hilarious to another friend. People run around screaming their heads off if they see the game offers to sell something cosmetic. But its no lootbox game everything cool awesome and mechanically important requires in game participation they have free cosmetic armor as part of events free skins etc. none of that is charged. So BS on the micro transaction system if you want to buy it you are welcome to. But its inconsequential.As a port I know alot of people shouted its low res. And? It was designed for consoles did you really think they are going to reinvent the wheel to put it on PC? No. It may have lower resolution than your 8k nonsense. But it still maintains beautiful scenery intense and fun gameplay and ridiculously hilarious moments. Would you say Skyrim is an absolute trash pc port because today it has lower resolution than games coming out today? No. Its graphics are not its biggest selling point. Its gameplay and its multiplayer aspect is. Nothing is more exciting than you and a group of 3 friends going off to hunt a monster take it down after failing time and time again and being able to cheer and say we did it!In the end if you even REMOTELY liked dark souls you will love Monster Hunter World it has its unforgiving system that only scales to get worse. Finish the game at Hunter Rank 16? Nope! That last boss was really introducing you to tempered creatures then gigantic creatures. This game has a wonderful aspect to it but if you are looking for a easy casual game where it holds your hand this is NOT the game to buy you will get frustrated at times and will want to put a hole in the wall but through the perseverance of learning the mechanics and fighting the monster with 1 of 14 insanely cool weapons with unique feeling in each and dozens if not hundreds of upgrade paths with different looks damage types and functionality. This game will be a gloriously fun game that will keep you hooked for hundreds of hours. Worth 60 bucks.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD,1,
1219,"2018-08-12",7,75,30,0,1,"12.4 hrs on recordThis is my first experience with Monster Hunter and I absolutely loved it. It has a huge variety of monsters and armors. Boss fights are epic and intense. You can spend an hour fighting a single monster (and It's not boring monsters switch phases it gets angry and goes back normal then angry again then runs away from you to its nest or another place) you fight with it then chase it maybe he/she even will fight against another monster during this chase (and this helps your hunt. So It's a really good strategy to pull your hunt next to another monster) and finally you kill it and carve/skin it to obtain materials to craft your armor. Do the same route with another monster (and of course with same monsters to complete your set) and upgrade your gear and have more fun playing it. It has a beatiful environment design beatiful maps. Game is not difficult to understand after spending some hours with it. There aren't any classes there are different weapons which gives you different kind of playstyles and different combo attacks. Some of the weapons are easy some of them needs a bit more practice to understand. Monster designes are unique and fascinating. If you like Dark Souls series you will definitely love this game and its a bit harder than dark souls after you advance it in story. It gets harder and harder but It's the fun part. It's fun while you're alone and It's much easier when you're with friends and of course more fun in my opinion. The things that I didn't like are few 1 Joining friends is really broken right now but servers are probably overloaded so It will be fixed soon I hope.2 We can't invite or join friends to missions from its beggining until the cutscenes. Ok I understand that they want us to experience cutscene story on our own but why I can't play and advance in story with my friends. We could have that choice too. You're not able to do the same quest in your questline with your friend because only the ones who completed that quest can join your hunt. I'm talking about only storyline quests because there is no limitation in casual hunts/investigations so I'm talking about co op campaign. So they made it a bit confusing and I don't really understand it why but If some of your friends is ahead of you in story he can join and help you.And there is that. The whole game is an amazing experience for me and a huge beggining for CAPCOM to taking the good old Monster Hunter back to our lives. It's a whole different platform for them surely and It's a perfect start to begin with. This game is already one of my favourite games in all time. I will be spending hours to this game and will be looking forward to expansion packs and new games of Monster Hunter.

1221,"2018-08-11",0,0,17,0,0,"Multiplayer is so INCREDIBLY BAD! Prepare for hours of frustration as you try to progress through the main missions. For no reason you have to play through on single player until you see a cutscene. People say you can SOS flare at that point but that has never worked you have to leave and restart the mission to play co op. You have to do this on pretty much every main mission.Outside of the storyline it's a little better but not much. Disconnects that aren't actually internet related are common apparently for everyone. That gets really frustrating during a long fight.It's also difficult to get into the same group together as there is a complete lack of a party system. Each level you queue for is referred to as a party but once it's over you split up. The game is popular right now so everything fills up immediately.And if all of that wasn't bad enough if you get disconnected from a game (which is never internet related!) you can't rejoin it because your spot is filled with a message that says ""Player left the game"". Rather than reserve that spot for you to rejoin it blocks YOU (but not others) from taking the slot.Consoles apparently had a squad system but they pulled that for steam groups I guess but there's no features for that aside from showing your steam group icon by your name.The multiplayer in this game was designed by someone who has never played an online game in their LIFE.",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD,1,

1229,"2018-08-13",1,4,160,0,1,"Hi hi! I feel bad that it took me so long to write this review... I have been slamming out hunts all weekend long and forgot to take a moment to give a thumbs up to my FAVORITE VIDEO GAME in ages.This could be the best game ever. Sure it has plenty of flaws... Squad system removed for PC optimization issues with some graphics cards and dc's. Honestly the biggest issue is Steam Big Picture Mode running in the background and handling controller inputs.That said this is not only the best Monster Hunter game ever... But ITS ON THE PC!!!Throw your money at CAPCOM right now and tell them that WE WANT MORE MONSTER HUNTER ON PC!!!As a veteran hunter there is absolutely no reason not to buy play and love MH World.From the perspective of a new player YOU WILL NEVER KNOW HOW MANY AMAZING QUALITY OF LIFE FEATURES WERE ADDED TO THIS VERSION OF THE GAME THAT PLAYERS NEVER HAD BEFORE. You can complain about the little things lack of tutorials sketchy options for voice in random multiplayer lobbies difficulty scaling... THIS IS LEGITIMATELY THE BEST VERSION OF THE GAME EVER RELEASED... and in the last one everyone could go aerial and leap to the sky for mounting attacks without a ledge!This game is the dog's (that's British for Amaze balls). 31+ monsters to hunt each with different moves tells difficulty features (most monsters are featured multiple times with different scaling challenge) and challenges (including but not limited to elements elemental weakness attacks defenses. Every part of the monster has its own hit point pool. You can wail on a single part of the monster and break it (or stagger the monster!). You can focus the head to break it and send the monster reeling. You can cut off tails. Now (unlike before) you can see battle damage on the monsters as you beat them to ribbons higher fidelity graphics and textures and added features like heart rate monitors capture guru and quick deploy traps included for everyone!There are 14 different weapon types each with at least 15 different weapon trees to choose from. The weapon types all come with extremely different features and play style. I don't think anyone could play them all and say they didn't feel compelled to play at least one of them. I have more of a struggle to pick ""only a handful"" to focus on because of crafting cost and resources. Ranged weapons melee weapons shield weapons technical weapons. There are weapons of so many types someone who just wants to be able to spam one button and doge can do it! Meanwhile other players want something super complicated like juggling 2 transformation types charging phials with energy combos with guard points (so you can block passively while comboing if you can time it right) and slow moving attacks that hit for HUGE numbers. There's even weapons for people who just want to learn timing and become invincible by blocking any incoming attack at exactly the right time (within milliseconds). This game has something for everyone.I can't say enough how pleased I am with this game. I would have written this review before the game released on PC if I could have. I have compared the PC version to the console versions and I have to say it is GREAT. Sure they could have pushed the release back more than 8 months to polish up a few features that are less than perfect now... But I would have played it in a super incomplete form 8 months ago if I could. This game has so much to do... I don't have enough time in the week!All that said this game is not actually for everyone. People who don't like challenging encounters will find themselves up to their eyes in them one after another throughout the whole game. People who don't like working hard or repeating quests to attain self imposed goals... There's a lot of that in this game. People who regard story so far above game play and combat mechanics that they would prefer a visual novel over dark souls. This game is not for them.However if you LOVE games that are super challenging (because that challenge is returned in rewardingness... I don't even think that's a word. The game is sooo rewarding because it is so challenging). If you love finding sub systems that can help you to overcome a challenge OR if you prefer to brute force your way through a challenge with skills alone. This game is for you. If you like super deep crafting systems where you need to collect hundreds of different types of materials to craft tiered items that continue to get better and better as you go. If you love games where the combat is so well balanced that you can literally take any weapon of the same tier and know that it is balanced yet completely different stats statuses and elements. If you love games with options and open ended quest lines where you can do whatever you want in order to obtain progress on the side while you take down this mountain of a monster. THIS GAME IS FOR YOU.Big swords fast swords flying swords shooting ranged swords. Small monsters medium monsters giant monsters. Character customization AND the ability to change your hair style/color makeup style/color armor color mix and match sets for fashion or skills or defense... did I mention SWORDS?!?This game has it all. Most of the people who are down voting this game either have not given it a fair shake have a singular isolated issue or are complaining about denuvo. This game is top tier apex tempered deviant and raging.I rate games on a buy wait for sale or never touch it rating system. This game is an absolute MUST BUY.",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD,1,

Not to mention the biggest gripe the game runs like absolute garbage right now big fps drops random stuttering or complete freezes. Unlesss you have the absolute newest CPU right now don't even bother attempting to play this game. I'm running a gtx 1070 with an I5 OCed to 4.0 and 60 fps is a rarity. I hate giving this a negative review because i've played monster hunter since ps2 era and now the dream is real it's on pc and it's completely lackluster. Capcom needs to get to work and start optimizing this game and actually add support for pc hardware or else this great game will be a complete waste. Let me just throw in a lot of people are trying to defend this poor port by saying people should have the newest pc hardware to play this. Well that's all you really need to read from them to know their idiots. This game runs pretty decent on ps4 and it's what 4or 5 years old now? The pc port has pretty much zero upgrades and it runs like dog crap It's a shame Capcom was so lazy with this game.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD,1,

1241,"2018-08-12",0,0,266,0,1,"Before purchasing Monster Hunter World keep in mind a few things.1. It's a console port. It's made for controllers. It also doesn't have EVERY PC setting available however it does have quite a few and it does run in 60 fps / no limit.2. Monster Hunter is not Devil May Cry. Hell it's not even Dark Souls. The weapons and general gameplay are heavy and deliberate. You can't turn on a dime while attacking can't cancel every action into another action and you must time your attacks according to what the monster is doing. Button mashing will get you killed and off your teammates because yes you can hit them.3. Capcom is not known for PC ports. The fact that they brought one of their biggest most popular titles to the PC is actually very astonishing and I applaud them for doing so.Now the Pros + Absolutely beautiful game.+ Character creation is robust and has quite a few options. Perhaps not ""Black Desert Tier"" but you won't have much trouble creating an awesome (or troll y) character. + As stated earlier combat is heavy and deliberate. Everything feels meaty and the animations are absolutely superb.+ Lots of things to do. I've only played about 15 hours so far so I've only scratched the surface (if I remember to I'll update my review if needbe)+ The world feels extremely lively and is filled with animals you can kill capture or simply observe.+ Multiplayer is extremely fun. This game feels designed to play with friends.Cons. Playing with friends is way too complicated. You can create squads (Or for the PC version Steam groups. You choose a Primary Group in game and that basically becomes your squad. Creating a steam group with friends you wanna play with is definitely a good idea) but if you want to go on an expedition or do story based quests there are alot of loops you have to jump through. The meaty combat also means it's very easy to ""miss"" enemies especially small ones. You have to constantly reposition yourself and the lock on function only slightly helps. Lots of menus. LOTS of menus. There's alot of information being thrown at you almost at all times and it takes some getting used to. Controls are fine but it feels like you have to take one too many actions to do things like equip new items and use them. the Durability system. Not a big fan of it especially since I use weapons that lose durability extremely quickly (like the insect glaive). Always sucks when you finally knock down a monster and realize your weapon is now too dull to do optimum damage. Unskippable cutscenes. Oof. I don't mind them not being skippable if you haven't seen them yet but that's not the case here. They are always unskippable. When I first started I made a few characters so I could show my friends and we can choose which one I'd use for my full playthrough. I had to sit through the starter cutscenes and tutorials for a whopping 4 times. Well at least they were pretty. No lip sync. Not a big deal really this game comes in a number of languages so it's understandable. But holy hell is it noticeable.With all that said I definitely approve of this game and welcome anyone to come join in.",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD,1,

1255,"2018-08-19",0,0,205,0,0,Monster hunter world is a fun satisfying single player game. However it is not at this time a multiplayer game. Playing with a group of friends has been a trial most quests require everyone to go forward see a cutscene then abandon the quest and remake for everyone to play together. Some days we will be disconnected every quest and not only does it disconnect you but it puts you back in your own offline session. You can continue to fight but the monsters stay up at scaling for 4 players instead of scaling back down when there is only one player. The disconnects wouldn't be as much of an issue if they fixed the monster scaling or the monster scaling wouldn't be such an issue if they fixed the disconnects. The fact that the PC version had 6 months additional development time and this issue wasn't resolved (and so far hasn't been fixed or even lessened in the first two weeks of release) indicates that this is not a priority for the monster hunter team. I would not recommend this game for multiplayer content.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD,1,
1256,"2018-08-24",0,0,340,0,0,"The game's fun but probably not worth the $60 it's going for. There's definitely some good and bad things about the game but I'd have to say that the bad parts outweigh the good (for me at least). This is coming from someone who's played a majority of the MH games over the years.EDIT I forgot to mention this when I first wrote the review but the emphasis of the game is placed more on your interactions with the monsters and the environment rather than adding great amounts of content to the game. While I wouldn't suggest this game to people much because of the content to price ratio that's kind of just my personal take on it. That being said' I've gone back to slightly edit my initial review because I didn't mean to sound overly negative about the game. It's still fantastic to me I just wouldn't suggest it to everyone that's all.There's pros and cons to nearly everything in the game so I guess go down the list.MAPS The maps are fantastic and overall really high quality. There's a lot of little paths to find and the areas themselves look beautiful. My only issue with maps is the fact that the hardest to navigate map is the starter map? I don't think that's a great idea in a game catering to a more casual audience. The first map in the game is extremely windy and make good use of the Scoutflies but once you get to all the other maps they all seem fairly simple compared to it. They're still great but compared to the very first map in the game the all seem to lack something in a way I can't really explain.Also the researchers found on these maps are fairly useless as well. They give you one or two quests that usually involve catching a small monster of some kind then you're done with them and you never have to interact with them again until you see them on a new map. I wouldn't call it an open world game at all and I'm not sure why it was marketed as such. The maps are all split up into their own areas in the classic MH way however there's no loading zones of any kind when you're walking to a new tile. They all flow wonderfully and it's great seeing where a specific monster is flying to just by looking up at the sky.MONSTERS There's an extremely small amount of monsters compared to previous games. As an example and you can check all of this on the Monster Hunter Wiki but here's a quick rundown of a few other games and monster amounts (including variants) MH Freedom Unite (PSP) 81 total monstersMH Freedom 2 (PSP) 71 total monstersMH 4 Ultimate (3DS) 98 total monstersMH 3 Ultimate (3DS+ WII U) 73 total monstersand finally MH World 52 total monsters (although I believe there are a couple more on console)The only thing that really makes up for the small monster count is the multiple levels at which you can fight these monsters with there being LR HR Tempered Tempered 2 and Tempered 3. Along with plenty of missions and the addition of investigations you'll see them all plenty of times and by the time you get to tempered monsters you have a basic idea of how they all work.Their moves are still pretty much the same as previous games if they've already made an appearance before so if you've seen them before be prepared for a lot of really easy fights.The addition of the new smaller wildlife is pretty cool especially since you can add them to your room as pets. I feel like the smaller wildlife could have benefited greatly from a lot more color variations just to make them all feel a bit more different.WEAPONS There's 14 weapon groups giving a huge variety to how you play out your missions. Not much else to say about them other than the fact that the training room is a massive help to learning the combos right off the bat and hills are fun. Hills are your best friends in this game.STORY Laughable. Actually laughable. You'll have a fun time going through it because it feels like there was little effort put into it or maybe the translations are really off. The story makes you look at the monsters as both pests and something to research and you have many quests to set up camp in areas where a large monster happens to be walking by and well ""we can't set up camp with this guy walking around! Go kill it."" That's what a lot of quests feel like too. The writing is really bland and really you don't feel a single thing for any of the characters in the game because they just don't really bring anything special to the table. You're gonna hate the Handler by the end of the game if not near the start of the game. The story in the end makes very little sense and you don't really feel like you're going through any sort of story at all really. It doesn't take too long to complete although it may take a bit of time if you're new to the series.EXPEDITIONS The ability to go just gather resources without being pressed for time is really useful allowing you to really learn the maps and also go hunt monsters as much as you please. However why does this not add to your rank? I've done countless expeditions and caught many monsters but nothing you do in expeditions counts for your hunter rank so in the end there's no point in actually doing them to hunt down monsters. Quests will always be more worth doing also because of their rewards.WESTERN CATERING/DIFFICULTY Oh boy. It caters to Western audiences a lot. The game as a whole is a LOT easier than previous games but probably not so if you've never played a MH game. Crafting is simpler and has no fail chance health is easy af to obtain and allows you to make a lot more mistakes than normal and overall materials are much easier to get (but that's mostly because the maps are huge and thus need to be filled with resources). You probably won't even use Mega Potions until you get to the Elder Dragons. Maybe 50 hours into the game you'll have all the supplies you'll ever need for the rest of the game. Ancient Potions are still hard to come by but Max Potions and foods of any kind are easy to get. Not to mention the Canteen exists for the sake of having max health whenever you go into a fight.QUESTS There's plenty of quests to go through in the game along with a handful that appear later on at specific ranks and after specific Tempered Monsters have been fought. There's the Assigned story missions quite a few Optional quests you can join people if they fire an SOS flare and so on. There's also event quests that change every week which hand out all sorts of goodies like limited time armors. Some of the event quests give really nothing useful like the armor spheres. Believe me ALWAYS have Bounties going. You'll be swimming in armor spheres and the only way you'll run out is if you decide to upgrade every single armor set in the game. On top of all that there's investigations which are all you'll be playing later on to level up and get decorations.Overall I still highly enjoy the game but that's just because I grew up with MH games and I enjoy them through their flaws. I'd recommend this game if you just really enjoy MH games but I feel like it's not really worth the money. And now PC players have to wait for this version to catch up to console with the monsters weapons and actual really useful events. I'd suggest the game just for the gameplay itself but nothing else.Also for those who have never played MH games and you're thinking of getting it because the achievements look easy think again. The crown ones are entirely dependent on RNG and chances are that even if you're crown sniping you'll be hunting for a good hundred hours after you've finished the game. Just a word of warning.",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD,1,
1257,"2018-09-15",1,4,54,0,0,I have not been able to play this game due to an ERR12 during the opening cutscene.Yes I've tried that and that.The game straight up does not work.Windows 7 RX 570 i7 3770This game cannot be positively reviewed until it is fixed.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD,1,
1258,"2018-08-12",0,0,185,0,1,The multiplayer obviously has issues at the moment. It can be extremely frustrating to be separated from your friend in the middle of a battle and forced to fight a monster that is stronger than it would have been if you'd started off on your own. This would certainly be helped by being able to rejoin your friend on the fly. It feels unnecessarily clunky in its present state.There are other problems too I don't like the playing sessions being interrupted by missions with cut scenes that I have to watch on my own before I leave the mission and go back to play with my friends. If we'd just been able to do the missions together from start to finish that'd definitely be preferable. It's a pet peeve of mine to be forced to do missions on my own in a co op game.However with all of that out of the way when everything works the game is an absolute joy to play. The environments are beautifully designed. The battles are fun and engaging. The animations have real weight to them and I find myself grinning and enjoying even little things like sliding down hills or swinging monkey like from the vines. There's great variety in the weapons that seems to produce pleasantly different play styles and I'm not sure I could ever dislike a game where I get to toot a humongous horn even as I bash it into my enemy's head.Going for expeditions and just gathering materials fishing or chasing cute little critters for my collection is a nice addition as well as it's something to do when I'm feeling too casual to go toe to toe with something big and scary.All in all I see myself putting a lot of hours into this. I couldn't possibly give it a thumbs down simply because of the issues I explained previously... even if I hope they fix the problems. 8/10 with the current troubles with a possible 9.5/10 down the road.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD,1,

Same problems on PC. obnoxious menus Excessive tutorials Unfriendly user interface for keyboard and mouse users System to collect parts from monsters after defeat needs significant improvement. Often if there is some other item/track near the body of the defeated monster you will be offered to loot that instead of the monster despite having a time limit to collect your rewards from the monster you just killed. If these issues were addressed as have been comlpained about for some time now this game would be perfect. It is unique and very fun requiring strategy adaptation and creativity. Beautiful environments as well.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD,1,
1260,"2018-08-14",0,0,225,0,1,Amazing game straight up. I only am writing this review for the first time to the disagreement of the other reviews having problems with it so far.I don't know what's up with their internet or PC but the game works fine. Not Perfect because Yes even I had trouble coming to the Error 50382 MW1 but I assure you it does work if you put just a tad bit effort in like creating a new session or whatever.This is by no means a bad game because It's Monster Hunter that originally was supposed to played on PS4 not PCI don't know if you truly expected a PC Port to be 100% Perfect from a company that already puts so much effort into a beloved series and has NEVER done a PC release like this. I'm completely baffled by the amount of ignorance and hatred it gets that gets sent because of it.Give it time and it will work. There will be hiccups sure. But it has worked for me. They've never placed Monster Hunter on a PC so you gotta give em respect for atleast trying to do their research hence the long 7 months it took for it to release. And I have never lost faith in a Monster Hunter game. It's my all time favorite Series since Freedom Unite and I HIGHLY recommend this game to you and friends.Seriously if a friend can play it and connect to sessions on a potato of a laptop and internet. I'm very sure there's not much excuse here. All I'm asking is that you can wait a bit longer or play the game cause it deserves to be played and respected as a GOOD game.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD,1,

1276,"2018-08-12",2,5,99,0,0,All right game with bad console &gt pc port.(hopefully I will change review to positive after some fixes)Main issues so far bad performance (that cpu usage WTF) bad connection (both stability and dont like overall multiplayer lobby/connection design) lack of many options that us pc gameres are used to have (mostly detailed graphics settings lack of resultions etc.)game is still not designed for mouse/keybord. its playable but feels akward (i had to manually keybind and still we dont have acces mmo like quickbinds cmon i have entire keyboard and i still have to scroll through 10 items to pick the health potion i need) price tag on this game are you serrious with this new dlcs? game is so expensive and you release emotes for money o.OLets talk about actual gameplay now.Dont let first 2h 3h of gameplay disapoint you. Monster hunter feels to slow at the beggining (steam refound policy should be stretched a lil bit for this game).+The amount of content seems good (played 20h so far looks like main story will take me about 50 60h) but thats with sticking to one loadout. For completionst to craft every single item in game its probably 1000+h.+Monster/world design is very good.+fighting monsters is very fun for most part tracking/chasing monsters sometimes takes waaaaay to long Game gets grindy pretty fast ui is not clear enough menu on top of menu and another menu tutorials some basic stuff is over explained in detail but than you encounter a weird game mechanic thats not even mentioned. attacks are towards where your character is facing not where your camera is facing. I get it its supposed to be skillful and console games like that have auto lock on but now we can play with mouse so disable auto lock on and let me aim with mouse untill i plug my controller back in (this point is probably personal preferance but still had to put it here).At the end my suggestion for pc players. If you are not sure if game like that is for you/its too expensive/will not run/will fry your cpu just go and try Dauntless (f2p). Better quality in terms of pc standards but much less content atm.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD,1,

1293,"2018-08-13",0,0,141,0,1,Product received for free. I haven't written many reviews before but I'll do my best with this one. I've been playing Monster Hunter since MH3 on Wii and man has it been a journey up to this game. My friend gifted me a copy of this game and I appreciate it very much. I'd been waiting eagerly for the PC port and I am so glad I waited. Personally I really love this game and honestly I'm so spoiled by World that I'll find it hard to get back to the older games. I'm quite looking forward to MHGU on Switch at the end of this month we'll see how well the adjustment goes for me.*I recommend a controller to play this game. I have heard the kb+m controls aren't so fantastic.PROS +Unlimited pickaxes/bug nets/whetstones? Yes please. Running out of pickaxes or bug nets during a quest always sucked hardcore. I love picking up materials on each quest I go it makes it so much nicer to have both of these unlimited without taking up an item space. Oh and whetstones too though you could argue it wasn't very easy to run out of those anyways.+Fast gathering? Hell yeah. It always felt incredibly slow when you would have to do a gathering quest in the older games (looking at you MH3). I absolutely love how you can run by something and gather it with just one button press and I adore that when you DO have to do the sometimes tedious (some more than others) gathering quests it gets delivered without having to go back to the camp. Except y'know good old egg quests.+No more paintballs! Once you've studied enough tracks from a monster your scoutflies will level up and start leading you to where the monster is and they will show up on the map. I absolutely love this improvement especially for those times I forgot to paintball a monster and completely lost track of where it was. It also saves some time (if your scoutflies are a high enough level anyways) since you won't have to look for the monster in each area. It's also nice to see where each gathering material is on the map and how long it'll take to replenish itself.+The enviroments are amazing. I love how MHW utilizes most of the things that are in the area surrounding you such as sporepuffs or poison cups. It's also fun to see big monsters trap themselves in vine traps from trees they knock down or just hiding in a bush and watching a couple of them duke it out with each other. I love the interaction that each monster has with each other. Instead of just auto aggroing the player (most times anyways) they start a turf war until one runs off in shame.+MHW is very beginner friendly compared to the old titles. I feel as if this game is much easier for a new player to get into seeing as how different it is from the older formula. My first time playing a MH title was not a kind one but I learned to love it as I kept playing. Now I'm enjoying a game that I love with a new style with my friends who haven't played the titles before this one.+PETS. You can collect pets to decorate your room. Who in their right mind doesn't love collecting cute cool or interesting animals to spice up a place?+POOGIE PETS IN HD. Praise be to Poogie.+Weapon changes. I feel like the weapons have changed at least a little bit from what I've seen of them in the old games. I main switch axe and have for quite a while now and I love love LOVE the combos! I also really like the design of some of the weapons (some better than others of course..)+Layered armor. Whaaaat? I think its a really neat addition to the game and it may possibly bring fashion hunting to a new light. I hope to see a few more layered armor sets I like the samurai one from the deluxe edition but I like having variety too.+Palicos are great in this game! In the previous titles there was an enthusiasm system for your palicos. The lower their enthusiasm the less likely they will be to fight. There also used to be different classes/specializations of palicos and they would have certain monsters or duties they would do (i.e. fighting large monsters only support bias etc). At the beginning of the game when you first get your palico it has a gadget called Vigorwasp spray that heals you reliably so (at least in my experience). There are times where they pull a Donald Duck move from Kingdom Hearts and heal you after you've already used a potion. There are different palico gadgets that you get through the game mainly from optional quests so ultimately you decide exactly what you want your palico to do. Also most the armor for them is just so freakin' cute. Capcom is really after my heart with this game.+NO LOADING TIMES BETWEEN AREAS. FINALLY it really broke immersion in the previous titles how there was always a short loading screen between each area but it was useful for when you wanted to get away from monsters to heal or.. do whatever you need to do really. Though just because there aren't loading screens between areas in this game you can still either hide in bushes (your screen will indicate when you're hiding with a kind of black border? I'm not too sure how to describe it so well but you'll know when you see it). Either that or you could use the Ghillie Mantle (which you get pretty early on) to basically become 'invisible' to monsters until you attack or the mantle runs out of time. Ghillie Mantle is VERY convenient for the egg quests.+Free content. There are a couple of event quests that come out at specified times (schedule here http //game.capcom.com/world/steam/us/schedule.html) and from what I've read from previous posts from Capcom some of these events come with special materials to make rare layered armor sets. Of course the upcoming events aren't as cool as the ones out for consoles but that's mostly because the PC port just came out and I am positive the cooler quests will come later down the line.CONS Some of the settings interfere with the FPS from the get go. For better performance I recommend turning off volume rendering and playing in borderless windowed mode. I'm not actually sure if there are any other settings that should be turned off so if you know any I don't please let me know! The main story is kind of bland in my opinion. Traveling to a new land when suddenly OH NO an ELDER DRAGON APPEARS TO BE GOING TO THE NEW WORLD!? We have to FIND IT and CAPTURE IT and then RESEARCH IT! It's personally not my favorite but I haven't finished the story all the way through so I'll update after I've done so. At the moment multiplayer doesn't seem to work too well. You also have to disband your group after each quest in order to go back to the hub. Remember the monster turf wars? Yeah sometimes those get a little bit annoying. Though its really fun to watch another monster get beat down it can drag on for a little bit too long when I'm just trying to farm or end the quest. Sometimes fights make your FPS crash hard but I suppose that's what happens with most games when too much is going on all at once. If grinding for materials isn't something you enjoy I wouldn't recommend this game. Personally I like the grind but I understand that not everyone enjoys the time (and sometimes frustration) that goes into it. If you're looking for a hack and slash game this definitely is not it. The combat is rather slow but incredibly rewarding once you've learned a monster's patterns when to dodge and when to use your combos. Though combat speed varies with whatever weapon you use (i.e. dual blades are faster than hammer). No Sophia AKA Guildmarm from MH4U. I miss being called doodle. Event quests are no longer permanently in your quest list. In older games when you downloaded a special/event quest you could do it whenever you want. For MHW the event quests are only around for a specified amount of time but I believe they do come back around.Overall I've had a blast playing this new entry in the Monster Hunter series and I look forward to the future. I'd really like to see everything Capcom has in store for the next games.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD,1,

1299,"2018-08-23",0,0,22,0,0,"What a weird and wonderful land I have fallen into! As a MONSTER HUNTER (RAARR AT ALL CAPS!) virgin I basically bought into the hype of this thing. Its a series that goes back to much older handheld devices and it sells in the millions. This version alone had sold 7 million copies on console prior to PC launch. So whats it all about?I think the name pretty much tells you what you will be spending your time doing in here! If you ever played FFXIV (the first version) this game really reminded me of that. While not an MMO it does support (questionably) 4 player coop. Part of that design is very good you can setup a mission and either wait in town for people to get ready or as the host depart yourself still allowing others to join once they have finished preparing. It also features drop in/out. All sounds great BUT the way the campaign missions go you need to watch the cutscenes ALONE *before* you try do it with friends. Each of you need to start the mission and watch the cutscene alone and then quit out and team back up with your friends?!! The connections have also been iffy. In my limited time trying to play with randoms disconnects can and do happen much too frequently.The game itself is intriguing. While you get some easy to follow tutorials to begin with (thank coz I had no idea what I was doing) you will find there are layers to this thing things you wont find out easily unless you like to experiment or go watch some videos of others who have done that part already.The controls are fairly console y. I have only played it with a controller (as I generally prefer that in a 3rd person game). There are a range of weapons which each handle differently and I am lead to believe they are all viable. You can try them out in a training area which also gives you a HUD showing each action. Nice for a noob like myself. There is some amount of clunkiness to some. ATM I am using a hammer its a large 2 hand and as you would expect its slow really slow! Obviously it hits like a truck but damn its slow! The basic 3 hit combo which ends on a nice strong hit is what I have been aiming for but as it takes a number of seconds to get there and you cant do much while you are swinging there is some guess work involved in order to land the hits. This would be fine but adding in the sometimes really odd monster movements and it can be frustrating.For eg I have just farmed a Rex type mob (Anjanath) and what happened a number of times is he falls over moving several feet away not long enough for you to run all the way to him and get off the 3 hits so you run part of the way and begin your attack. The first 2 dont hit as you are out of range but his weird roll he does when he gets up puts him merged with you and your 3rd powerful hit ends up going on the far side of him! Its just how it is with this game (And that particular weapon). Im pretty sure if I requested tips on the forum I would be torched. I get it I suck and try another weapon...You can feel the games heritage. Some things feel like they have been fleshed out over the iterations. But the controls are ""quirky"" and require a bit more adapting than I would like.There is a deep crafting tree for your weapons and armors. You do get to put what you carve from your wins (or captures!) to good use. It can feel a bit too grindy at times. But I do keep going back to try some more things so it must be doing something right?!The game features decent options for Audio and match making. The graphics side comes up a little short tho. Not only is it missing some expected options (blur for eg) but some of the options actually do nothing at all! On top of that the game has *worse* textures than consoles!!? Thats pretty bad!Performance isnt bad. Altho as ever with a game that requires a certain amount of horsepower theres been plenty of threads complaining about FPS. I have the game maxed at 4K with the fog turned off (nothing I miss and it sure gives you a nice FPS boost) capped for G sync in town its pretty much locked to just under 60fps out in the wild and it does sometimes wobble but it spends most of the time in the 50s and is perfectly playable (1080ti itching for a 2080ti.. counting the days). Despite allegedly requiring a decent AND modern CPU some users of 1st gen i7s have reported it plays fine.So ultimately its a thumbs down for now. The 2 main points for this are the networking problems and broken graphical options/and some truly poor textures (see pic below). They may both be resolved with patches I will update my review at a later time.Too high a price for what you are getting. I got it for 39 from Voidu happy I didnt pay full price. It doesnt feel like its worth the full whack IMO. If the 2 things I mentioned do get resolved pick it up on sale.https //steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id 1472630665https //steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id 1490542712Update 19Sep Just a quick update some patches in the last couple of weeks have seemingly cleared up the connection issues.

1309,"2018-11-21",0,0,119,0,0,+Good Excellent graphics for a Monster Hunter game plus it's available on PC! Interaction between Monsters (Turf wars) and enivornment add a nice touch to the game. Lots of endemic life to search for and collect. Bad There's a very underwhelming amount of monsters to hunt on this game compared to other MH Games. This in turn leads you to barely any variety in End Game builds. Elemental damage really gets shafted in this game compared to other MH entries (Which also indirectly leads to less variety in end game builds due to everyone running high RAW weaps for optimal damage instead and makes collecting every branch of the weapon tree kind of pointless). Babby's first MH game gives a lot of hand holding you know there's something wrong with how difficult the game is when I was able to clear the Story's final monster using LR Legiana armor. Tempered and Arch tempered monsters is a very lazy way to re use assets to make up for the lack of challenging monsters. The only replay value from the post game of this comes from the tedious RNG grind for jewels and stream stones. TL DR The only main edge this thing has over the other MH Games is that 1. It's available on PC and steam2. The graphics are good.Other than that the scarce amounts of monster variety makes this game not worth the price at all.Overall Rating 4.5 /10,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD,1,
1310,"2018-08-11",2,7,80,0,0,I absolutely adored Monster Hunter World when it came out for the PS4 and proceeded to sink over 200 hours into the game (rookie numbers I know gotta' pump 'em up) but opted to take a break to play other games while I waited for the PC port to come out. This was mainly so I could play with my friends. Monster Hunter World has absolutely AMAZING gameplay and is perfect for people who want a good looking grind based game. However I can't honestly recommend Monster Hunter World in this state on PC however for a number of reasons.I could deal with the lack of options for motion blur or more granular options for video settings. I could deal with the multiplayer connection issues despite the fact that the primary reason that I bought the game for both myself and a friend was to play together on launch and help people in low rank while we geared up. I could deal with the weird texture bugs and other visual side grades that make the game either washed out or the water reflections not working as well as they do in the console variants.I could deal with them if all of these things came together for a game that ran at a consistent 60 FPS above the 1 settings at 1080p. As it stands many people are having extreme issues running the game at anything above 45 fps with some settings on and in a lot of cases even if people can end up tweaking their games to reach 60 fps and slap on that wonderful vsync (because screen tearing is rampant) there are a metric BOATLOAD of performance issues not limited to stuttering incredible framerate drops and frame time issues during end game monster hunts (Teostra Lunestra anything with a fair amount of particles) a certain area in the game running around 20 30% worse than other areas among other things.But on top of that there is absolutely no implementation of VAC or other anti cheat software alongside the game... while a significant implementation of Denuvo was put into place. The time and effort that was expended to do this could have been spent shoring up the game's performance on launch or at the very least a bit more QA when it comes to it. It's unfortunate that Capcom decided to launch this game in such a sorry state because from a gameplay perspective this has to be the best Monster Hunter yet especially with the quality of life improvements made for new players.I'd say that if you don't already own it on another platform you have an extremely high end / beefy rig still make use of that refund feature and come back in a couple more months after Capcom decides to fix their game to the point it should have been at at launch of PC.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD,1,

1318,"2018-08-22",1,6,64,0,0,"There is some good and some bad to Monster Hunter World (PC). If the game was polished and the development team shipped a complete and functioning product like they claimed they would I would recomend this game. Unfortunately even after taking six extra months to ""make the PC version right"" all they managed to fix was adding DRM.The big cons 1. Terrible multiplayer constant disconnects. Don't expect to play with your friends regularly and you will lose fights 40 minutes in when the multiplayer dies. No reconnect.2. No real mouse/kb support. Translates mouse input into controller acceleration.3. Many bugs you will probably have some random crashes mid fight. Some have save file corruption.4. Poorly optimized performance on PC. I have a 1080 and it runs fine but still lags out when several large monsters are in the same area at once. I am sure on a 1050 1060 you will see it often.Now beyond the poor PC port the game is actually pretty good. I was a little bit unimpressed that they could not modernize the tutorials instead a big text box pops up mid game all of the time requesting you read and click accept. Very 1980s I figured capcom was better than this.The graphics are actually really good and the monster animations are pretty good. More color to differenciate damage states would have been nice. There is no blood but I think that would have helped.Tracking is way too easy. In prior games you actually tracked monsters in this game you send your scout flies to find the monster than you follow them to the monster. Might as well just be an arena game no skill in tracking. Quests are pretty repetitive but killing monsters is always fun. I think monster fights could be a bit shorter though they get repetetive. Overall I have played many hours of this game because I enjoy the monster fights but think capcom really missed an opportunity to fix a lot of these issues and have a steller release. I'd give the PC version a 6/10 for the reasons above and raise it to a 7/10 if they fix their bugs and networking.",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD,1,

Multiplayer is flawed hugely with disconnects and the game soft crashing while infinitely searching for servers. PC release was delayed for 6 months for the exact reason of making the servers better. We waited. But for what?At anime north and other conventions I went to while waiting for the release the MH cosplayers I talked to were all waiting for the PC release. Negative review for treating PC fans as second class citizens.I will probably go on to play a few hundred more hours of this game because it's good despite the disgraceful treatment of fans.Update Forget what I said about playing the game for hundreds of hours this installation of MH has less content than MHTri.

If you are worried that it is a bad port due to some arsehats review bombing the game I wouldn't be PWeek 1 Update Played far too much this week P Having heaps of fun only real annoyance has been the occasional disconnect during multi player. I did some research and added some port forwards to my router as well as laucnh options that seem to have helped maintain a more stable connection. You wouldn't know if from the forums but it has been a pretty smooth launch week IMHO PWeek 2 Update I love the emergent gameplay when you are hutning one monster and a whole bunch of monsters start fighting each other right on top of you! It can be sheer bloody chaos P Still getting disconnected in co op a couple of times a night not in love with that issue hopefully a fix gets released soon. It is very hit and miss!

1327,"2018-08-17",1,5,0,0,0,Bad porting. The mouse controls are absolutely abyssmal making the combat very clunky. I couldn't find the settings to change the mouse sensetivity nor to disable the mouse accel. The mouse sens is locked as if it was a joystick. The input lag annoys me the most. I particularly dislike the motion blur the FPS drops and other FPS issues mid battle. The graphics could've been optimised better. Unskippable/Unpausable cutscenes. Uncancellable attack animations. Bad Focusing the camera is focused but not the attacks. There are no options to select what you want to throw and sometimes when you want to attack using a bow you're throwing stones instead of firing an arrow. The item slots are uneditable and they are tucked into a single corner I'd need to keep scrolling through the tiny item slot in the corner just to find the item that I want to use especially bad mid battle. The battle mechanics are somewhat confusing they should really utilise the shortcuts properly. The Menu UI and the HUD could've been made better it's really strenuous manually navigating through when you could just use shortcuts. Server issues need fixing I keep getting disconnected from the server otherwise I couldn't connect at all. It's a good game but these issues need to be addressed.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD,1,

1352,"2018-08-26",0,0,117,0,1,Online Is Fixed (For Me) EditionThe Good Combat feels very satisfying and weighty and offers a play style for everyone via the 14 different weapon classes that can be switched to freely between missions. Attacks can not be animation canceled so you have to be more calculated than in other action games which I feel is a nice change of pace. Overall the core gameplay loop of gathering materials hunting monsters and crafting/upgrading items and gear is quite fun. There's always something new to build toward or a new personal goal to meet. There's a lot of character in MHW from the weapon and armor designs that tell the story of what a given hunter has accomplished to the silly animations when diving or cooking just to name a couple of my favorites. You can even capture smaller creatures and keep them as pets in your personal quarters. Overall the game is very charming in so many different ways. Hell I can't stop humming that damn tune that plays at the HQ. Also can't wait for that free DLC.The Bad Online was broken for the first two weeks not acceptable. Game did not launch with any of the DLC that is already on console. Cutscenes are unskippable and doing co op in story missions is a pain since each person has to watch the cutscene in their own mission back out then make a new mission. The cherry on top is that the story itself is completely throwaway. It's not terrible but a story that evokes nothing is often times worse than something truly awful in its own way. No transmog armor despite overwhelming demand for it enjoy looking like a clown or having an unoptimized hunter. Performance on my i5 6600K + GTX 1070 was less than I expected. Lowest dip was to 30 when sleep bombing an Anji in the forest average is around 60 70fps with rolled back driver version 398.36.Verdict In most other games the bad things wrong with MHW would be so annoying despite being so small (like a gnat) I would never think to recommend it especially since I think most issues like the cutscenes transmog and story mission co op issues will never be fixed. So it's all that more meaningful for me to give MHW my overwhelming recommendation. The game is blast to play pure and simple and will only get better as the free updates roll out. This is my first Monster Hunter game and I've bought it three times. Once on PS4 once on PC for myself and again on PC for a friend. Despite its flaws I would not hesitate to do it again.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD,1,

1355,"2018-08-19",0,0,433,0,1,"After almost a 100 hours in the game i feel like it is time for a review of the game.First of all lets go over the issues i have heard about others experiencing.Apparently some people have had their saves corrupted at the end boss. I had no issues so i can not confirm this.Performance issues occur but there is already plenty of people with guide lines and such on how to increase performance.Controls i refuse to play with mouse and keyboard on this so i have literally no experience with mouse and keyboard.Now lets get to the actual review. Story The store is pretty good a few characters are extremely cliche to the point they are not even named. I feel the progress is just right new monsters gated behind a combination of the story progression as well as locking the players Hunter Rank based on their progress in the story. This combines to a steady progression through the game getting better gear to beat stronger monsters. Gameplay The gameplay is generally fluid with some insanity happening on rare occasions. Monsters interact fight and chase eachother out of areas or even killing one another. Placing a trap can help out a hunt a lot such as tinged meat to paralyze a creature under a trap or working together with your friends to literally ambush a monster at its nest.When it comes to the ""insanity"" i do not just mean the occasional glitch some funny fights can occur when a bigger monster joins your hunt for a small one. Graphics Not much to say graphics are honestly fantastic. I find myself literally stopping in the middle of hunts due to the sun rise or a amazing view. Usually i get a reminder in the shape of horns piercing my behind.So all in all would i recommend the game? Yes definitely. BUT please check the internet before raging due to a issue i can almost gurantee there is a solution out there already.Such as doing a backup of your save before fighting the endgame boss..",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD,1,

1362,"2018-08-21",0,0,110,0,0,"I waited for this game's PC release impatiently. What was delivered wasn't what I've expected.The main game was extremely short for 60 . After the main game you can start grinding and levelling your Hunter Rank to further upgrade your equipment and fight against the same monsters but with more damage. But the game quickly starts feeling extremely boring afer completing the story. It's not like the story was any good but you got to unlock new areas monsters and equipment as you progressed which felt very rewarding.Sometimes like randomly when you try to slay an enemy one or sometimes even two large boss enemies will coincidentally pop out and meet up on the same spot. The announcement trailer showed how Anjanath and Rathian fought against each other. My experience is 80% of the time at least one of the two or three enemies will focus on you instead fighing each other even though during that they hit each other with their heavy attacks. Like ""Sure I will hunt down that annoying human when a Rathalos fires a full charged fireball at me."". So to me it is rather a nuisance than a feature. You can use an item that makes one enemy bail out but still an annoying and unnecessary game mechanic since you don't always expect this to happen. I am not sure about this but I also got the feeling that they aren't even damaging each other. Never occured to me that the monster I was hunting died or starting limping after receiving couple of hits from other large monsters.Tried playing Co Op with friends. Can't really recommend. I don't know how exactly the game scales the difficulty with a party but the monsters became way more tankier and I was better off doing the quests alone. Esspecially because the whole team is allowed to faint at maximum up to three times. Some quests even allow less faints! Also as a closed ranged hunter 50% of the time you need to chase the monster since the AI very often changes its target and runs between them.Speaking of Co Op. I was trying to help a friend since his savegame got corrupted and he had to start a new game. I wanted to carry him through the beginning quests quickly to where he used to be but technically I couldn't. I always got disconnected due to communication errors.The gameplay is really difficult at the beginning. Most weapons felt clunky to me. I decided to go with the longsword. The game didn't teach much. Looked up tutorial videos on the weapons. After getting used to it a little it was really fun esspecially the counter mechanic and mounting enemies. But there were still things that bothered me Just pulling out the sword take years. Some combos make your character automatically pull away your sword. Really questionable decision Capcom went with.Receiving 1 combo deaths is common due to stuns large enemy tag team attacks and whatnotAnimation of bouncing off of armored parts is extremely long and will often give the enemy a free hit on you even though you didn't meant to hit that part. Happens a lot with the longsword due to its length and the slow attack speed.No animation cancels. Once you've comitted to attack and within milliseconds you realise it was a mistake you can't cancel and side roll or counter. Extremely frustrating since post game you can get 1 hit killed or late game 1 comboed. I wished one could have more control over his character. I despise clunky gameplay and stuns and think it is really bad game design. I like to have control over my character and not being locked into slow animations. The only weapon with high speed are the dual swords but they are really situational due to their short range which I didn't like. The game could have been made more difficult in other aspects like more limitations concerning healing resources for example. Having less healing means in exchange for more swiftness and control. That would have been nice.I would recommend this game if at least Price drops to maximum 20 (Except they release more content to justify the price)Connection issues are fixedMore Content is released (Main Game is too short. Post Game mindless grinding.)Everything else is still bearable.",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD,1,

1364,"2018-08-09",0,0,5,0,0,This is my first time really playing a Monster Hunter game. All my friends (Monster hunter enthusiasts) have been waiting WEEKS for this to come out.We played 'Dauntless' while waiting and hopped right in and had fun. Not nearly as polished or complex as this game.. but at least it was enjoyable to play.This experience with Monster Hunter.. I went in wanting to like it I didn't. It looks beautiful but the gameplay just wasn't fun. The combat didn't seem enjoyable.. I'd like to give it another chance at higher level fights maybe craft some neat armor with the stuff gathered.. but so far it's just a very beautiful setting without really a lot of 'fun' other than navigating menus and gathering stuff.We spent most of our 3 hours trying to get multiplayer to work and/or work through tutorials (which are irritating since they try to rush you through with audio prompts and directed cameras.. Either make a smaller tutorial area or let people explore the one you give them without being reminded every ten seconds..)The fact that you have to run for miles just to get to the cutscenes to the point where you can play with friends was not fun.We finally gave up when we kept getting dropped from the co op game once we finally got to the point Pros Beautiful and engaging maps lots of things to do and gather. Climbing around the maps feels very engaging Monsters look pretty cool and there's a lot of visual variety.Cons Pushy AI during tutorials Clumsy menu layouts and somewhat confusing .. I don't want to have to do an internet search on how to make my net (which had been working fine) start working properly again after it randomly started shooting rocks and killing the animals I was trying to capture. If it has altenate ammo options or something that should be able to be seen from the main screen without being a rocket scientist. TERRIBLE system for playing with friends in the early game (not sure about later?) they can't join unless they've seen all the cutscenes for a hunt so they have to go through half the game and THEN you can join them. (And then they get dropped.) You have to literally jump through hoops to close the game. No option to just 'quit' from a hunt even without saving. You literally have to go into a menu end the hunt go back into a menu and then end the game for real.We played for hours and honestly had very little fun other than enjoying the aesthetics and moving around the big maps. I would have refunded it after 2 hours but I bought it through an outside website that doesn't do refunds. I'm very easily entertained by many different games but I feel like this one has serious issues if you want to play with friends. If you want to explore a world alone and see cool monsters and craft a bunch of stuff with their parts it might be fun for you.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD,1,
1365,"2018-08-12",0,0,184,0,0,Well this game multiplayer server issuses are real. It's really bad and demoralized playing. When I was hunting a big nasty Anjanath and then I disconnect with friend now I need to hunt that **** myself for almost half and hour. Very fun Capcom.And I just yet not mentioned how main quest is omplemented for online. How the hell I need to watch cut scene seperately and join the game again for playing together. It's very dum*b and you can look at how Overwatch implemented cut scene. It's far mile better.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD,1,
1366,"2018-10-14",3,16,256,0,0,This review is written by a player new to the franchise.TL DR ++Immersive monsters ++Armor customization and selection++Weapon customization+Weapon diversity+Reguarly adding content Grinding Difficulty Port Hub Story Repetitive RNG based elements The Handler HitboxesStoryThe story itself is fairly uninteresting. It serves mostly as a way of introducing the world and the monsters to you. Not at any moment did I sit on the edge of my seat in curiosity for what was to be come next. Therefore the story should not be your reason for playing this game.GameplayI do find the gameplay fairly disappointing mostly because of its lack of accurate hitboxes. It can be a real annoyance at times especially when the monster can one shot you. For example it is not uncommon for you to get charged for as far as I can tell its full damage when you re standing BEHIND your target.The monsters can also often roar CC you and gets quite annoying when it happens multiple times in a row.There s also a random chance of getting stun after being hit which can guarantee your death if you re well unlucky.The targeting system is horrible with M+K. Better off aiming manually all the time.. Flash Pods are absolutely broken and make any monster that flies into the air a joke except situationally metal boii.Walking up a climbable vines/walls makes you climb automatically even if you re using an healing item and therefore canceling it. This can actually kill you when you re accidentally walking into it backwards.You can get pinned down which seems to have no other purpose than killing you by being unable to quickly move out of terrain that damages you.Your attack animation seem to not be accurate in conjunction with the actual hits. For example hitting a monster and seeing your weapon pass the monster entirely can not hit if the monster roars or hits you right after that.Your cat s abilities can often get ignored when called for and calling for them requires you to put away your weapon. This can cause you to have to repeatedly sheathe your weapon to call for it again until he does it.There seems to be no way to guarantee a mount (skillfully) it just seems to be a chance that slowly goes up. Other than that the mounting itself takes no skill after you realise that it's just pressing the button that the right top of the screen tells you to. It also seems that CC chaining monsters is the highest tier gameplay which is fairly disappointing.Disregarded all these imperfections the combat is fairly enjoyable and decent.DifficultyThe game does not pose a challenge skillwise it poses a challenge in preparation and knowledge. The most important to winning the game long term is to upgrade your equipment and weapon. For short term with a specific boss this means having good/suitable Skills bring the effective consumables use a weapon that has a status effect/element that counters it and to obviously know its general moveset.The game s difficulty is mostly just pumping up numbers make monsters hit harder and give them more hp. You generally have the low rank version the high rank version the tempered version... and possibly the arch tempered version in the future (some variations miss the low rank and/or tempered versions). Besides that they recoloured a few bosses and called them different. For example you have the low rank rathalos the high rank rathalos the high rank blue rathalos the tempered rathalos and the tempered blue rathalos. They possibly changed the moveset a tiny bit but I honestly can t tell. The monster variety seems to be too small for a game that focuses on killing monsters and a lot of monsters are very similar. They are supposedly adding frequent free monster updates though which does ease this issue.ImmersionWhat I believe the game excels at most is the immersion. The monsters feel very realistic and it can feel like you re hunting a real dinosa.. monster at least in the beginning. The immersion does wear off fairly quick once you kill the same monster a few times and start to understand its general pattern. The terrain although sometimes somewhat small can feel very immersive because of how distinct the terrain is clearly an eye for detail.The scoutfly system does ruin the immersion a lot though. These shouldn t have been constantly present. There s a mod to remove it though.Lip sync is off not everything is voiced and the lines were not written well.Characters are named by their role. They literally couldn t even name your Handler or any of the expedition leaders.WorldIt is NOT an open world game.The hub is especially badly designed. There s a lot of running around for the occasional micro tasks you should be doing because the locations are not optional you even need to go through a loading screen for one. There s actually a fast traveling mechanic within the hub for covenience but they re not well placed and missing in the most essential spot (the place you spawn...) .There s a countdown after finishing a quest which means you may have not enough time or too much. Should simply have an option to leave whenever you want after finishing.There s no retry option or proper stay as group option (staying as a group in an expedition is not the same especially when everyone has to accept the next quest all over again).MultiplayerHub seems to be mostly for playing for friends and for arena should ve raised the capacity so you can have an active quest board. Also could ve made your hub fill with players and not just purposeless NPCs.The SOS system is nice for getting random people into your hunts although I believe it shouldn t be main co op method.A leaver in your quest cannot be replaced which means if someone is intentionally doing nothing you either can kick him and get no replacement or let him get double value by looting or doing nothing and still getting the boss reward.The multiplayer only scales for solo or multiplayer not depending on the amount of players. Arena is always scaled for multiplayer (unnecessarily).GrindingThe game seems to like grinding... It really really likes grinding... If you re not a fan of it I suggest you better be satisfied with only completing the story line because nearly all the customization requires grinding. The bosses get repetitive and boring quick once you kill it 10x in a row which ruins the immersion a lot. Just so you have a 1% chance of getting that one thing you want.CustomizationThe character customization for your character and your cat are pretty extensive although I did miss the common body height/type modifications.The different armor sets seem very unique and you can switch them around. You can also create interesting Skill combinations.The weapon customization is even more diverse. At higher rank this allows you to create specific weapons to counter specific monsters. UIThat chat bar is bad.The order of consumable items does not seem to consistently save meaning you often have to reorganise it if it s your main way of using items.The game forcefully changes your camera angle when it thinks it locates something important even when it means locating a monster that is infront of you by turning your camera around.SOS quest board search critera does not get saved.Port/OptionsYou can rebind keys for melee and ranged weapons but not for specific weapons. The last should be a thing because the weapons are generally very distinctive and deserve their own kind of keybinds.Quick access menu in combat allows you to sharpen your weapon while it is out but it cannot be done with the normal use item menu (???). Overall I'd not recommend this game at full price unless you're a MH fan. 50% off is probably what I'd consider its value.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD,1,
1367,"2018-08-16",1,27,317,0,0,"I can't recommend this game to anyone on PC in it's current state. When it's not being a giant pile of bad it's super good fun. The constant disconnects and poor performance are incredibly frustrating. Having to re create a lobby after every disconnect and if your team gets disconnected mid fight you are stucking fighting a monster scaled for multiplayer difficulty with just you and your near useless AI companion. It's not always a pleasant situation.The performance is abysmall in a lot of situations. Kiss your frames goodbye in the elder's recess. Run the game on Low Med and hope for the best. This coming from a guy with a Ryzen 1700 3.6 32GB RAM and a 980Ti and aftermarket cooling. Against fights with a lot of effects like Kush and Teostra you're frames will take the biggest dump. Got people with elemetnal weapons and bombs all going off at the same time? You'll start wondering if the latest drivers you installed actually fixed anything. Linking up with the disconnect issues every time the game disconnects you FROM STEAM steam reconnects itself and then causes a stutter in the game because Denuvo is a thing causing more grief and headaches... it hurts.The controls can be remapped for keyboard not for controller. Not the biggest issue but kind of a ""Why not?"" kind of thing. The mouse is a glorified thumb stick. No matter your DPI the camera doesn't move at 1 1 with your mouse. Game can still be played with M&amp K I personally would not.I'm still gonna play the game as my rose tinted glasses pushed me well past the refund mark But for the rest of you Avoid this game. Don't even get it on sale. Wait for reports of an update that actually fixes the flaws we're suffering through now. If No Man's Sky can make a come back...

1377,"2018-08-12",1,1,5,0,1,I'm not that far into this game but from what i've played so far it's an MMORPG that actually has a different approach to things. The fact that a monster will behave differently depending on how injured it is when it tries to run when it sees that you're about to kill it add a lot of immersion into the game.The combat and equipment system is unique as well you don't change armour and weapon sets all that often you rather level them up with the smithy. And there aren't any armour weight classes either so you can mix'n'match different armours so you can get the most balanced protection against most elements or wear the same set to get a lot of protection from a single element if you wish that. Cosmetically mixing armour sets also looks good.The combat system in this game is very fun and different from most mmos (reminds me of black desert online) however unlike BDO you have to wait for your combat animations to finish before moving again which is annoying as if a monster circles you your character is standing there hitting the air like a muppet and you can't cancel the animation in anyway.Another bonus being that from what i've seen so far there aren't any pay2win elements in the game and it would be taking the p**s if there was as i paid over 40 for this game.The graphics in this game are good and i can run it on medium/high settings at 1080p at a constant 60fps with an i5 7600 and a gtx970.One small negative in this game is the audio sometimes the animations and the audio desync and cutscenes look very odd. To conclude i think monster hunter world is a very good mmorpg and if the small negatives that i mentioned in this review are patched then it would be amazing which is i am giving it an 8/10 verdict.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD,1,

NEEDS MORE DARKNESS IM HUNTING MONSTERS.I did enjoy making my character tho really customizable with alot to changes.Im still not sure what the game is directed to be. A multiplayer co op monster hunting game? Cant be surely if you cant see your friends outside of quests? Why let us join a 16 slot server with randoms if you cant even see them (bar one location)? Its surposed to be MONSTER HUNTER yet ive got a scrawny cat next to me fighting dragons. 5/10 Dont buy this game expecting to enjoy it with friends.

1382,"2018-08-15",0,0,95,0,1,"Starting up for the first time froze everything unless I kept my hands off and let the program struggle to survive. Connection drops all the time. After all the hassle it runs fine though maxed out on my low/mid range PC. Lots of graphics look horrible such as the LOD for animals going from fully rendered to 4 frame prerendered slideshows if they go further than 10 feet from you. Other stuff looks amazing and I'll just sit and stare. Obviously they had to make decisions of which aspects to downgrade and which to keep because players look at different things in a game and you can get away with blah blah blah. But a bird flying infront of me is something I'm gonna be paying attention to. Meanwhile tree canopies fully rendered. This isn't even a PC complaint that's something that shouldn't have been on the consoles either. The streamline the UI for making armor but when you want to upgrade you have to go back to scrolling through pages of icons on a grid for nostalgia's sake I guess. The new investigations and bounties are also very clunky the 3DS version of 4U managed to be more intuitive with them. The monsters die way too quickly the AI for moving to different locations tends to freak out especially when roaming monsters bump into them. The environmental elements like slinger ammo and poison/para plants and animals are a bit busted. I got one pickup for my slinger that just guaranteed flinched monsters so I could cancel big moves and the AI would just sit there processing ""well now what?"" If they added all these ways to damage the monster that you can use when having a weapon out isn't viable they should have INCREASED the health not lowered it. Armor sets got mega simplified and basically your choices boil down to what skills are on what armor pieces. They still haven't really solved the issue of why you would ever stack elemental resistances unless you're garbage at the game and even then it's just objectively dumb because elemental damage makes up like 5 percent of a monster's attacks. The voice acting is a bit cringey for English and the lip syncing was so bad I had to disable it. The pop up heads for dialog looked bad and said some really obvious stuff such as ""he fell over"" when you trip or stun a monster. In the hub you have Mr. Tan screaming at you to go on the next story mission every 2 minutes. Fishing managed to get even more simple. You can make all these animals your pet but not Mosswine?The fights feel way more fluid now. The environments are beautiful and varied and there's so much to explore. The weapons all got some love and lots of added depth. The slinger is fun and fresh but a bit overpowered. You can finally aim bowguns and bows with a mouse. The plot's finally something ""new"" compared to all the old titles. It feels like you have an impact on the world now with how camps are put up by you when you find suitable spots captured animals appear at the hub people approach you for requests and not ""Wisened Veggie Elder"" or whatever the board lists as the quest giver. A training area is a fantastic addition. Relegating grind quests to investigations and also making harvesting much quicker is probably the best addition to the series ever. An actual tutorial is nice but they kinda wasted it on movement mechanics then went back to the old formula of teaching you stuff as you go felt like an afterthought that should have been fleshed out more because the series can be very confusing and scary for newcomers. Whetstone being unlimited use is nice. Lots of small changes that are welcomed overall.It's a good experiment and I'm optimistic for the series but there's much tweaking to be done to the formula.

1384,"2018-10-14",0,0,348,0,1,"80% of the bad reviews are people complaining that Capcom isn't catching us up to console fast enough. Is it a valid criticism? Yes. Is it worth a negative review? Absolutely not. The other 19% is people complaining about optimization issues that have either been patched by now or players figured out solutions to within hours of launch. The final 1% is people that for some reason bought this game with no idea what was in store for them or just geniunely do not like this game. This game is absolutely worth your time. A lot of your time actually considering i have 250 hours on the console version and 190 hours on pc as of writing this review. This wasn't my first MH game but i absoultely believe it's the best entry point for the series. Just enough content to still retain the expansive monster hunter feeling of ""what should i do next"" while not having too much to the point of feeling overwhelming early like Generations or Generations Ultimate (both of which are ""series celebration"" games meant to feature as much nostalgic content as possible anyways. World brings a lot of new things to the table. It takes many of the ideas presented in Gen in the form of Hunter Arts and Hunting Styles and mixes them into the core of many weapons. For example Longsword now has a counterattack reminiscent of adept style.Optimization is also much better than people were initially bandwagoning. The PS4 Pro gives you 3 graphic presets to choose from. Boost FPS Resolution or Graphics. Using the FPS boost the PS4 Pro will average around 40 45 FPS. Choosing Resolution allows you to pass the base 1080p which is useful for huge TV screens. Choosing graphics will slightly boost the lighting effects and that's about it. As for the PC graphics the medium settings are about equivalent to choosing the graphics mode on PS4 Pro. I run this game at 1080p 60fps on the highest settings with an i5 7600k at 4.3 Ghz and a GTX 1080. My friend who has a GTX 970 and an old AMD 4 core that runs at 3.4 Ghz can easily run this game at medium settings 1080p 60fps meaning that a fairly low end PC can more than match the PS4 Pro. This is a fairly well optimized port.All in all this game is absolutely worth it if you're interested in Monster Hunter at all.

1392,"2018-08-20",0,0,73,0,1,"My recommendation is only based off of gameplay. I will highlight the technical mumbo jumbo but this is NOT taken into account with this game review.Monster Hunter World is what one could call a ""reboot"" or a ""next gen successor"" to the Monster Hunter franchise. While now on the PC the game has been out for a while on the PS4 and XBOX One.You hunt monsters you capture or kill them you gather their bodily parts such as carapaces fangs and tails. You take them and you craft armor and weapons out of them. Then you do it again.The game itself is different from previous installments as it features now an open world instead of instanced map zones. For a review please check some big mumbojumbo off of some company who actually went over to review the game.While the port itself could have seen more polish it runs fine on my machine. But however until Capcom sorts some stuff out there are some performance issues here and there and there are its quirks. By no means is it unplayable on my 9 year old CPU but there are only certain fights where my framerate drops below 60.Some people are complaining as well that they are constantly disconnecting. This is something I have not noticed and only have disconnected about 3 4 times in the span of 50 hours of gameplay from online services.I can only recommend the game. Capcom IS going to sort out some of the technicalities and improving on the game because we're on PC we can patch things.However if you're the kind of person who wants no issues when you buy a game I can only say to wait until more things are patched.",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD,1,

I had to refund it though because I kept getting connection errors. For the price i don't want to play a 50+ hour game solo. I have other games for that kind of experience.

1396,"2018-08-17",0,0,89,0,1,This is my first Monster Hunter game.While the game isn't perfect it is definately a good game and I had fun playing it.Graphics are excellent overall so is the sound.Gameplay takes a while getting used to but is good once you get used to it. Each weapon plays very differently from another so there is plenty of variety.There are a lot of different monsters in the game which provide a good amount of variety.Storyline is simple and works ok. Don't expect a deep story with complex moral choices.The meat of the gameplay is a bit repetitive find tracks and clues about a monster guiding you to find said monster. Fight the monster and either capture or kill it. Get monster parts to craft/upgrade gear. Repeat.You will see many people complaining about optimization. While I do admit it could be better I don't have any problems playing on max settings except fog and shadow at 1080p. My graphics card is decent. A nvidia 970.Negative points include drop chances on certain items are really really low meaning if you are unlucky in drops you might have to hunt the same monster 10 20 30 times maybe more and still not get what you want.Character detail in some cutscenes seems fairly low.Not everything is voiced over. For an AAA game in 2018 that seems just lazy.No way to pause the game. I could understand in a multiplayer session but when I'm playing alone again that's a lazy design choice.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD,1,

Combat feels the same as other games with some slight improvements (I roll with the hammers because stunning is a force multiplier) in regards to certain jump and sliding attacks.All around I'm pretty impressed with how the game feels now love fighting the new monsters. I can't give negatives to online disconnectivity because... well... its a right not a bloody privilege.

1406,"2018-08-16",0,0,46,0,1,This is a pretty cool game but it's not extraordinary. Most of it is fun and the exploration is neat but my biggest gripe is the combat. Everything you do is at a snail's pace. This is NOT a fast paced combat game. It is just a combat game. I never thought I'd say this but the way your character lumbers and the controls respond it's worse than a souls game. It takes 5 seconds to heal it can be hard to interrupt your moves if need be your character attacks in the direction they're facing and not the way you're looking which yes it seems logical but for a video game it's very counter intuitive and on top of that it takes ages to turn your toon around. That wouldn't be so bad but the monsters hop about and jump around and it can just be utterly maddening at times. So it's fun for multiplayer and OVERALL it is a neat game but I think it would be more enjoyable if the combat system was just a tad more fast paced.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD,1,

1409,"2018-08-15",0,0,82,0,1,Fantastic MH game. Game looks great especially in 4K. Nice to finally have a Monster Hunter game on PC thats in english ). This game has a host of graphical settings that can be adjusted to suit your rig. I don't understand the bad reviews on this game as it's only been out a very short time. As like any other game that gets released there will always be problems at launch. but give them time and they will be ironed out. Just remember that on PC especially there are so many different system configurations that people have it's gonna take time to make it work flawlessly on some setups. Back to the game in hand though it is great fun especially when you play with friends though there are certain aspects of the game that require you to play solo before they can be played online with friends but this doesn't take the fun away from the game by any means. And of course as time goes on there will be New Monsters and DLC's added to the Monster Hunter World.

1413,"2018-08-12",0,0,83,0,0,Well. it's a fantastic game and i like it a lot. but here are two problems i ve met 1. those monsters are too real and lively they are like the animals in the realistic world and it's really hard for me to attack them when seeing them flee in a lame manner looking at them desperately flee from me really makes me feel sad and they are so poor. one giant dinosaur esacped from me and went home to sleep when i got there i see him snoring with bubbles on his nose he is so cute I CAN'T bear to kill him.... I want them to behave more evil so I won't feel me a bad person to kill them.2.The network connection sucks.in China you can never expect a continously hunt for 20 minuetes every time i will disconnect and i have to fight alone or even restart it from beginning. even using VPN does no help.

1425,"2018-08-17",0,0,106,0,1,The long and short of it is that this game is good. Simple. Having played Monster Hunter Freedom Unite for the PSP and Monster Hunter Tri for the Wii I can wholeheartedly say this experience doesn't disappoint. Since this is my only exposure to the Monster Hunter series this is the basis from which I'll judge this game.The additions and changes made to the series work well together the most prominent example are the changes to the levels. With no loading screens between rooms within a locale the devs were given the freedom to make crazy massive maps that are admittedly difficult to navigate. To counter the difficulty the scoutflies mechanic works beautifully and while the maps are large and multi tiered they also are memorable and reward memorization. The introduction and fleshing out of endemic life additional things that creatures of all types (endemic life small monsters large monsters) do in various situations and things like turf wars make this game extremely organic and vivacious. The addition of personalized rooms with pets and whatnot allow for a personal albeit cosmetic touch onto things and allow for a nice room to just settle in and relax. The fact that this Monster Hunter bothered to have a story is pleasing and it allows for a nice progression system throughout the locales and with different foes. I initially didn't think I'd appreciate a story mode in a game that proports to be multiplayer and is also Monster Hunter but I was pleasantly surprised. One final thing I'd like to say is I am very glad that they kept in expeditions and even expanded them from Tri. That was honestly one of my favorite parts of Tri just wandering the island.As per usual Monster Hunter World is extremely Monster Hunter. It is beautifully designed aesthetically with its odd and lively machinery it has the same gratification from wearing your foes. It also has the same farming for resources both directly (going on missions) and indirectly (using the farming mechanisms). The combat is still quite Monster Hunter and came back to me almost immediately. Of course I stubbornly cling to my longswords.On a more negative note I am a bit disappointed they discarded the swimming mechanics altogether. I thought they added for an interesting kiting dynamic trying to lure enemies out of water but I can understand why people would prefer it not being a factor. I wish there were more locales to explore but considering this is online I'm sure more will be added and the ones we have are massive and rich and pretty unique.All in all this game is great I'm so happy to see it on PC and I know I have many more hours with it in the future.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD,1,

1433,"2018-08-23",0,0,267,0,1,This game is amazing.As more of an explorer lot's of fun things to find.I decided to take it slow and play heavy bowgun which had a lot of ammo management but the game relents quite a bit and unlocks your ammo through an NPC instead of being an unending gathering for more ammo. I enjoyed myself thoroughly and never felt bogged down by overly tedious grinding.Personally this is now one of my favorite games. Were there connection issues? Sure but you know what happens when you're on a hunt with a group and it loses connection? It immediately drops you into a solo instance right where you left off one of the smoothest transitions I've ever seen it was a marvel of technology. That is the two times I actually disconnected... The online experience otherwise has been fantastic even with new players who might not take advantage of all the status effects.I wish this game had glamor armor for some of my favorite sets I know there's a mod out now (not sure if it's okay to use) that allows you to do this and I really wish they'd implement the functionality into the game. Dress up is important!This game is solid in balance mechanics gameplay and fun. The animations are as always for a monster hunter (even though this is my first one) incredible!For the four fulcrums of playersExplorer 9/10 Overall a lot of things to find but this game could use a few more maps! I had so much fun exploring every inch and all the maps were beautiful very happy with this game.Socializing 5/10 There are medium lobbies and people do like to talk but the steam group thing leaves a lot to be desired. No trading of course very limited interaction with other players. It's fun to exchange guild cards for people's cats! But I would've liked a central lobby (above 16 players) to interact with others rather than a rarely used gathering area.Achiever 9/10 This game's story completes at around hunter rank 20ish and in about 60 hours. After that there's a lot of optional challenges arena fights and end game stuff to get. Always feels like there's a lot to collect! I'm excited for more monsters and more maps but there is still a lot to get through here.Killer 2/10 You can stun other players in hunts that's about it this game isn't PvPOverall I'd give this game a solid 9/10. It does a lot of things incredibly well and it's obvious the development team worked incredibly hard on this game and every inch of it is incredible. The 9 is for the fact that I just want more of it and I hope to get that in future updates!,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD,1,

Unfortunately to play a game together you have to 1) Go solo into a mission.2) Find the monster3) watch the cutscene4) Abbandon the mission5) Restart the mission with your friends6) find the monster again7) kill the monster.And you have to do this for EVERY SINGLE MONSTER. It is so absurdly frustrating.Besides that look on the internet to disable the settings that make this game crash (set to windowless mode and something with disable sound rendering). Im not having fun grinding these boring early monsters so I can finally start playing the game with my friends on any challenging stuff.

You can meet lots of hackers that one shot monsters in multiplayer trully ruined the gaming experience of legit non cheater player. For this I thank god Capcom didn't implement cross play between console and PC.Now only... if only I can transfer my HR 500 1000 Hours All achievments achieved gameplay character from my PS4 PRO this at least would get a thumbs up from me.

1439,"2018-08-20",0,0,231,0,1,A review from someone who have played every single Monster Hunter game prior to this one.It keeps all the things that made MH games great and merely brought it into the current generation. It is as fun as it looks and can easily waste your afternoon without your realisation. It is as fun as it looks on youtube and other trailers it is a must buy if you like third person action games. The difficulty is lower than previous games. This lower difficulty can be partly attributed to reduction in arbitrary control scheme limitations and other hardware/software limits on the hand held and partly attributed to a lot more life experience improvements.If you are new. It is a fusion between dark souls and more hack/slashy third person games. The polish is far better than Dark Souls 3 you will not be frustrated by inching off a ledge or getting stuck on a small prutruding rock. The game play have more weight than common spectacle games like Devil May Cry or Beyonetta and involve a lot more RPG elements. The game is mainly about preparation patience and learning how to take down monsters either through gearing up preparing encounter specific consumables use environmental harzads and simply learning the Monster move sets.Currently the game is inferior to the PS4 Version since I have the following issues 1. There are a lot of connection issues the integration with steam is not gelling well.2. Control scheme is a little janky and need some polish particularly relating to mouse acceleration.3. Performance is also not well optimised. Most PC will be able to run it on console equivalent settings fine but once you turn it up it will start chugging PC even beastly built PCs that should be able to over power it. Particularly a few zones later on have strange text/effects that stutter the frame rate.4. DLC is not caught up to date with the console versions there are a lot of content still not accessible for PC players.It should also be noted Bulk of the content can be ploughed through in about 30 hours if you are god mode in 3rd person action RPGs. Most of the end game involve RNG loot farming and/or collecting fashion items. There are many different weapon types and most hunters try to get familiar with multiple weapons. There are some hidden jank rule about cinematics and unable to play multiplayer due to story reasons which isn't intuitive and is pointless. If you get the game get a controller. Conclusion It is a great game. There are technical issues that can absolutely break your experience and there is no way to tell whether it is compatible with your system probably wait unless Capcom patch the game before purchase. Otherwise it is a very solid experience even while solo hunting. 8/10.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD,1,

1443,"2018-08-15",0,0,604,0,1,The online experience as of first week post release ranges from anywhere between acceptable inconvenience to infuriating funstopper. With some of my friends I can play for hours without issues others get connection errors every second mission or sooner.The menu is obviously designed for consoles so getting through all the prompts and losing control of your character is somewhat unintuitive though to Capcom's credit the overall KB+M controls are decent which is unusual for this company or even rival companies from Japan.As a MonHun veteran I was worried for a long time that this release would casualize the game a lot especially with the damage output of the monsters but thankfully the community was heard and the numbers feel just right. There's a very well thought through progression system that is challenging but very fair with a good difficulty curve starting quite low with Tobi Kadachi and then ramping up steadily. Hitboxes are finely tuned I had no wonky moments I can recall happening.I'm very careful with how I spend money and take an extensive look at titles before buying them and deciding for this investment paid off dividents even with the connection problems (that will hopefully get resolved).One last complaint I have is that the story is really boring which wouldn't be a problem at all if it could be skipped at all. You are able to just click through most conversations but cutscenes have to be suffered through. Get ready to go afk a lot if you hate the story as much as I do.That said Monster Hunter is a gameplay focused experience and nails this aspect for me. Do I regret buying this full price? Not the least bit.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD,1,
1444,"2018-08-24",0,0,265,0,1,Amazing game!,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD,1,
1445,"2018-08-24",0,0,143,0,1,After The patch I only have few connectivity issues compare to the day before.The gameplay is fantastic! 10/10 for me,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD,1,
1446,"2018-09-04",1,1,77,0,1,I love this game. Let's talk about why. 1) The weapons. There are 14 base weapons to choose from at the get go. These weapons all have unique movesets and abilities and vastly vary your playstyle. There are daggers that make you get right up in a monster's face with quick attacks. There are heavy machine guns (complete with grenade launcher) that let you turn the game into a shooter if you're into that. There are massive heavy blades that evoke Dark Souls Ultra Greatswords. And then there's my primary weapon a spear that lets me jump around and fly. Equip a different weapon get a totally different game. It's pretty awesome. 2) The challenge. This isn't Dark Souls. Quite honestly the way the monsters telegraph their attacks is pretty straightforward even at the higher levels. But the thing that's happening here is that the monsters test your endurance and ability to keep your rhythm. A monster fight probably lasts about 15 20 minutes on average and in that time you've got to keep your head on straight dodge and weave appropriately and maintain your position. The monsters roam freely in massive maps so the boss arena constantly changes and the player is richly rewarded for paying attention to the terrain. You can trip some boulders to roll onto the monsters or trigger a landslide. The game rewards skill. By this point in the game I can confidently bounce off the ground attack a monster 40 times without touching the ground for about 10 seconds. I see other players try to do the same and embarrass themselves. That's a good feeling. 3) The Organic world. At any point during a monster hunt (although it seems to happen more often in multiplayer hunts) another monster can wander into the fight and attack everyone. You might be chasing a flying electric squirrel when all of a sudden a dragon swoops in and blows fire on your dudes. You're trying to focus the squirrel because that's your target and one of your allies drives off the dragon with a poop bomb but then all of a sudden a T Rex comes in looking for a piece of the fight. Then next time you go looking for another one of those monsters so you can use his to sharpen your spear none of that even happens and you get a straightforward 1v1. And I think that's beautiful. You really can't say how a fight will go down in MHW or what sort of s will show up. 4) Cats. Meow? Meow meow! Meow. As for flaws...A serious attempt has been made to streamline annoyances out of the game and the game deserves credit for it. There are elevators that let you quick travel up a set of stairs that take about 10 seconds to climb. There is autocrafting and 10 loadout slots for your item pouch. Did you forget to eat a meal before you left for the mission? No worries you can do it at camp. But the things that aren't streamlined stick out like a sore thumb.Multiplayer is really easy to do with randoms. Just launch an SOS flare and three guys will show up. Easy. Getting an actual specific friend that you want involves lobby codes gathering hubs and all sorts of t. You can't do a mission together until the ally has finished watching a cutscene and all sorts of red tape. They have this lovely Gathering Hub but there's absolutely no sense in ever using it. I can only assume that these flaws come from the console origins of the game but still. It's a shame. Nevertheless This is a great game that I'll probably keep playing for a long time. Best purchase of 2018 so far I'd say.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD,1,
1447,"2018-08-29",0,0,297,0,1,I LOVE THIS GAME.10/10 would drop out of class again... again.I use to play Monster Hunter Freedom Unite years ago haven't gotten a hold from any of the games in the series between now and then. But this? This? This is just... amazing. Much easier mind you or rather streamlined. Yet losing none of the charm nor the fun rather it gains. Beautiful landscape breath taking wildlife tons of variety in customisation. Something a hunter from a previous game can pick up and find even more to work with with added perks to each weapon and skill customisability and then master them ever further. I like the longsword and what they've added to it included the foresight slash and is just... it's just... wow. The satisfaction of nullifying attacks with closely timed execution is VERY satisfying. Beyond improving your character the improvement and mastery of your skills in this game is wonderfully impactful and satisfying. Love it.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD,1,

I cried a little bit because of how happy I was that this game was on pc and it looks beautiful and is a great story line with loads of quests cuztomization and most importantly MONSTERS! Playing is really fun I keep coming back eah time I get a bit bored or other games.BUTOne thing I can not stand about this game is that there are no reporting features. I have been encouraged to self harm harrassed a bit and all the typical ""troll"" whatevers that are meant to hurt feelings and get you to quit the game or something like that. There is no way to report them as toxic or anything and poking around the forums I see there is much worse than that someone was talking about being bombed repeativly at the final boss and such..Not sure..That is my only critique but other than that I LOVE THIS GAME",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD,1,

1457,"2018-08-12",0,0,13,0,0,I was surprisingly disappointed in my early gameplay experience. First I found out I couldn't remap the controller which is terrible since I've had decades where the X button position is my default attack button. End result is I end up spamming my potions when I should be attacking. It'll take hours of practice just to remove that reflex. The setting is less interesting than I had expected and the characters are bland and the story doesn't give me much motivation to continue. This feels a lot like FF13 in that it might be one of those games than only gets good after you've put over a dozen hours of work into it.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD,1,

1464,"2018-09-03",0,0,55,0,1,Easily the most accesible entry in the Monster Hunter series. I could never get into the others before this but World hits a lovely sweet spot for me. I hate grind (except for achievements) and while there is some grind in World it is nowhere near as grindy as the previous entries. The graphics sounds and map designs all help make your 'job' as a hunter all the more immersive and I simply love exploring the maps and capturing just about everything I could put my net or shock trap on.This is still not a game I would recommend to more casual audiences nor do I think this is the best game for Monster Hunter vetarans but it sits in a nice middle ground for the more common gamer with less time on my hands to grind mission after mission but still want some good hard earned progression.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD,1,

1477,"2018-08-23",0,0,18,0,1,I'll start this by saying that i don't own any console and never have and therefore have never played any previous MH game before. That being said i like pretty games. i like fighting with a sword. i like things that don't force me to play in first person. and i like mmo's because i like to interact with others in public areas. this game isn't a bad game but its not at all what i expected it to be and i must say i am not having any fun at all lol i thought playing Dauntless for the past few months would assist in preparing me for the difficulty of the fights but it didn't at all. I was stuck for 4 days on the Anjanath until i could finally get someone to respond to my sos and help and NOT die all 3 times so we failed. (most sos responders died 3x immediately. ugh. ) i managed to kill exactly 1 creature past the anjanath and am stuck yet again. also the game itself should tell you more. i had people tell me most of the commands and stuff but my issue continues to be being stunned as i'm trying to get out of range of said stun. i cannot figure out stun range. and if something can 1 hit me while im stunned theres no stun range and i cannot move fast enough to move out of range anyhow i am simply stuck. as i am now lol. again i'm saying i do recommend this game because while i am most definitely not having any fun at all whatsoever and wasted a solid $70 on a game i do not enjoy i think its a game others would enjoy. its just not for me. if a game is going to be this difficult it should be far easier to party up with people but it disconnects essentially every other time i try. so i end up solo'ing failing rinse repeat. its boring. i wanted a cool game to meet new people in and advance with them in this is NOT that. not for me anyway. i also felt the additional items granted with the $70 option were not worth it. i havent used a gesture not once ya know because whose going to see it when its just me running around? lol and i dont wear the samurai armor. so. meh. waste of money and time. for me. might not be for you. i've voiced my complaints to other folks i play with and they seem more interested because of them ha just depends on your playstyle i suppose.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD,1,

1480,"2018-08-15",0,0,302,0,1,So far what i can say is The dev's have really put their heart and soul into this game but parts of it feel overly complicated. It has a pretty steep learning curve as i'm still finding out. But while it's complicated and steep the feeling of accomplishment as you learn more and more about the game is pretty awesome. You can actually see yourself make improvements each time you take on certain enemies. There is one particular enemy i encountered in the wild and it absolutely destroyed me for the most part poisoning me on numerous occasions I then got a quest to fight the same monster and this time i beat it without being poisoned a single time. The fight still lasted as long but i was more capable after the first fight. I definitely reccomend this game as I note the dev's are also taking feedback from the community and bringing about changes they want to see. More people within the community can only help the dev's perfect this masterpiece in motion.My main concern is the complications surrounding co op play. Each player must watch the cutscene separately making joining each others' adventure pretty hard. We've found each player must go in(to the level/cutscene) and leave after the cutscene then the final player can set up the quest.But other than that and the occasional frustrating crash for no reason on start up i really really enjoy this game.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD,1,

This fine game is being ruined by multiplayer that should have been left to cook for another 3 4 months. Do not buy this game right now. Wait until all the bugs are fixed. Wait until all the BS is fixed. Unless you like hunting alone. Which is alright but enjoy bad framrates if you use Dual Blade or thunder weapons. Which the latter becomes neccassary down the road.

Now let's talk about the positives the environment and character designs are just brilliant! A sight for sore eyes indeed. Smart gameplay mechanics embedded into the 14 wepon types and the method of upgrading them is very smartly done the grind isn't a strenuous repetative process like the older Monster hunters or other such games (warframe I'm looking at you).The game dose a great deal in letting the players understand the how's and why's all you need to do is pay attention to the text and tutorial instructions from time to time ( or you could skip and head over to a wiki after wasting hours trying to figure out how things work) ALL IN ALL A WELL DONE GAME !

1489,"2018-08-17",0,0,27,0,1,"I ended up giving this game a recommendation even though a thumbs down would have been just as valid. There are some serious drawbacks to the game For a game that's pretty centered on coop (though you can easily solo it) it has BY FAR the worst multiplayer system I've ever encountered. Mindbogglingly ridiculous decisions by the devs that gets you thinking if they've experienced a single online multiplayer system in the last couple of decades. On top of that there's major issues with connectivity which means yhou'll get kicked from the online server regularly (this will supposedly get fixed shortly). Other than that there are some weird performance issues at times that even seriously hampers a pretty beefy system as mine (6700K and GTX1080) so a lot of people could have issues.So why the recommendation? Well looking past the other issues I have to say that I'm simply hooked. It starts out a bit slow and I found myself wondering ""What's the point"" in the first few hours as it's just one big grind. Catch/kill this monster upgrade your gear catch/kill the next monster rinse and repeat. But it's just such a lovely grind somehow once you get into it (and I'm only just getting started). I can't stop thinking about it when I'm not playing and find myself looking up different guides and constantly changing weapons as the 14 different weapon types are massively different from each other. It'll keep you on your toes.Another reason for the recommendation is simply that the current standing (43 % upvoted when I'm writing this) is simply not representative for the quality of the game. Try it out you can always refund if you simply can't get past the wonky online component.",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD,1,

1528,"2018-08-12",0,0,304,0,1,PC Specs i7 Intel 3.4Ghz 8GB Ram EVGA Nvidia GTX 980 SCI've played hundreds of hours on the PS4 Pro and seemingly countless hours since MHPortable 2. Having said that I want to weight in on my thoughts with the PC port of MHW.Game performance on PC Definitely broken including Textures and some lighting effects in the settings. Recommend you turn off Volumetric Rendering for MASSIVE FPS gains and also eliminates the pointless bleaching of the colors and contrast. LOD Bias set to Medium because setting to High like Volumetric Rendering just eats up way too much power. Resolution High Textures on Full Shadows on High Ambient on High Subsurface OFF Reflections On but the first two settings are key the rest is minor visual if any and barely any resources needed to power. With the above I have a solid 60 fps and very rarely pretty situational occassions when it dips below to 50s. Looks amazing overall I think and with a little more patching by Capcom this game will look and run even better. As far as the game itself goes it's a must play with controller. Even if the keyboard and mouse settings were good Monster Hunter games just feel so much better with a controller in your hands and I don't say that for many PC games. MHW is the best in the series for me and while not perfect the experience here is extremely satisfying once you get to Tempered difficulty monsters and the events they run including fun crossovers with Devil May Cry Street Fighter and Final Fantasy are fantastic!Unfortunatley it's a solo game for now since the multiplayer is broken and I can't stay connected in a party with any friends. All I can think is that Capcom didn't prepare well enough and underestimated the load the servers would be under. They'll fix this with time sooner rather than later I hope and till then I'll solo hunt like I almost always do. Groups are fun especially with friends but Monster Hunter is like Dark Souls in the sense that the thrill of killing a hard monster solo gives a fantastic sense of achievement!Despite the issues I still recommend this game highly even. The multiplayer graphics problems and other issues will likely get fixed in time and none of them are game breaking for a gamer like me. I'll update this post as the patches come in.Game On!Kinetic,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD,1,

They don't take to long to kill (Mind you I have only fought the first 4 or 5 so far.) The key board and mouse controls are not hard to use I got use to them after one hunt. I started with a controler but switched. Keyboard and mouse became more enjoyable to me. So if you enjoy other monster hunter games I would get this. I don't feel let down.My one issue is not being able to turn off motion blur but I wont let that ruin the game for me.I guess there is an issues with matching?

1540,"2018-08-19",0,0,55,0,0,*EDIT* They fixed the online experience and I no longer get disconnected however everything else is the same. It seems quite drawn out and grindy. You do need to find the weapon you enjoy and there's a lot to learn before you start playing efficiently. The mini missions before the bosses gets shorter as you progress. Still I would not recommend this game for retail price.Game is long and drawn out. Playing the multiplayer is the most frustrating experience I have ever had in any game ever. I do not know who designed the multiplayer of this game but that team needs to get cut. To play online you'd have to go through a boring 10 15 minute mini mission until you see the boss. Then you have to leave the mission and then post it up or shoot an SOS flare. That means your friends have to leave the mission to join your SOS. This is just a mild annoyance.The worst part of it all is that while you're fighting a big monster if you get disconnected you are stuck fighting the monster alone that is scaled up to however many people were in your party. So if you spent 20 minutes fighting and then get disconnected (which happens VERY VERY frequently) you are most likely going to die and then youd have to start all over again. I would get a refund if it didn't take over two hours to fight the first big monster with your friends.Absolutely terrible online experience. Please stay away from this game and save yourself some time and frustration.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD,1,

1550,"2018-08-19",0,0,86,0,1,"(If only Steam had a ""Neutral"" option.)At the time of writing this review the PC port of MONSTER HUNTER WORLD is very flawed albeit serviceable. The implementation of Denuvo DRM is very restrictive and surprisingly taxing on many computers requiring CPUs with FMA3 instruction sets (which are only available on CPUs newer than the Minimum specs for the game itself would suggest) eating into performance not unlike Assassin's Creed Unity did on launch. Several textures are muddy and improperly ported from the console versions and are not available in their highest resolutions as supported on the PS4 Pro or Xbox One X. Several settings (whether this is intentional or not) are not available to be edited freely in the Settings menu such as motion blur (being on at all times) depth of field chromatic aberration etc. And as many people probably already know at this point *numerous* connection issues making online play very erratic and inconsistent. In addition performance optimization is spotty at best making it hard to achieve 1080/60fps in the neighborhood of the 1 specs.Not all is bad however and Monster Hunter World still allows for a considerable deal of video and audio customization and the modding community is fairly active. As for the game itself Capcom has done a fantastic job. Gameplay is very tight and stays true to previous games while offering a fair amount of new gameplay mechanics and opportunities for the player including the slinger gadget. Multiplayer when it does work is very satisfying and provides an insane number of possibilities for co op play. Every single monster has its own unique behavior patterns and characteristics with a rather sophisticated (though at times questionable) AI encaptured within a living breathing ecosystem ensuring that no two encounters are ever quite the same.The reward system in this game is very cyclic but that's to be expected for a Monster Hunter Game you kill monsters to craft gear to fight stronger monsters to craft better gear to craft better gear to fight stronger monsters to craft better gear ad infinitium until you eventually have the best armor and weapons in the game. World's endgame is a bit improved compared to previous entries giving you more options and customization in how you want to chisel out your builds although you are going to have to work for it. The endgame is a steady grind but all the while you're constantly getting stronger via stat gains and personal skill.I wouldn't consider myself a Monster Hunter ""veteran"" (only really played Monster Hunter Tri and 3 Ultimate and played a very small amount of Freedom Unite) but I do say that Capcom did a very good job with this entry. Just a shame that the initial PC release had to be marred with so many issues. For that I can't wholeheartedly say that I truly ""recommend"" this game on Steam for the time being unless you can solider on through the issues but do get a chance to play this game sometime be it later when the price drops and/or when the bugs and probelms eventually get patched or play it on consoles.",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD,1,

However you are still able to play this game offline and enjoy the story mode. So I don't understand why many people are upset about connection issues as the game offers both single and multiplayer gameplay. Personally I haven't had any of my games disconnect and I played with a friend in Korea and I'm currently living in England. If you're looking to play this game with a group of friends then I suggest you wait until they stabilise the servers. Because other reviews have said that their is a online server issue. But if you can enjoy this game on your own just play single player in the meantime. Trust me it is worth it. I was only gifted this game yesterday and I am addicted. It's definitely a thumbs up for me disconnecting servers isn't enough for me to leave a negative review on this game. I have an AMD R9280X and I'm still able to enjoy the beautiful graphics!UPDATE Be warned once you hit HR this game likes to troll you. However it is still fun until you get randomly dropped off right next to Odogaron or in a swarm of Girros'. GRRRRR! Still love this game though.PROS Runs better than PS4 MHW (DUH) Visually stunning (Considering I have poor GPU) Large monsters are ACTUALLY challenging (Definitely a pro as easy quest games are boring) Endless amount of gameplay and content Fun times with friends Cute customisations Easy controller use (I use a PS3 controller)CONS The Handler Not being able to connect online (very rarely happens) Random location drops (Only happened at the start of High Rank) Not being able to skip cut scenes.

The game runs pretty well on minimum specs and anyone still complaining just haven t turned off Volume Rendering Quality which is the fps killer.General info Monster Hunter World is the fifth game in the series not including the g rank versions or spin offs of the other games where you hunt well Monsters and take their skin and wear it with a continuing cycle until you rage quit or you re done.Gameplay The gameplay is good and enjoyable like in the previous titles. With multiple weapons the game offers multiple game styles for all kind of players like the long sword for weebs dual blades for no skill people hammer for people that want to play whack a mole greatsword for THATS A LOT OF DAMAGE and the best weapon THE SWORD AND SHIELD THAT CAN BASICALLY DO EVERYTHING WITH NO PROBLEMS etc. Then comes armor skills that have multiple gamestyle changing abilities like wide range makes you a support making you able to use your own items that would normally only heal and buff you to buff and heal your team mates but the skills come into play in High rank and are really important to either make the monster you re fighting easier or to make a set to rek with the greatsword.Story The story is really meh as in I liked Monster hunter 4 Ultimate s a lot more for having an enjoyable cast of character with personality other than Look at me I curious about everything and I do nothing else useful than give you quests and try to kill myself in every cutscene in the game forcing you to fight the monster I almost got killed by or kill you in the process.Some things for newbies This game is the easiest in the series by far with multiple quality of life changes and other improvements like gathering is a LOT faster than in previous games and other changes that make the game less grindy and easier which makes this the most newbie friendly from the seriesFew gripes I just have a few gripes with the game like how there isn t G Rank or how I get poisoned by Rathalos more than Pukei Pukei and how I hate the puffball.End thoughts The game is good but it has a few problems that can mostly be ignored so buy it on sale but if you want the game right now I d say buy it somewhere else for cheaper.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD,1,

1566,"2018-08-16",0,0,320,0,1,Multiplayer actually works if you play during off peak hours of your region which would be 2300 1000. (Highly 0 for anyone past their mid twenties take my word) Also you have to make an Online Session watch the cutscenes trigger the SOS flare availability notification before your friend who has completed that progression to join your quest. The game is made as noob friendly as possible with your button queues explained in every part of the interface even at the top right of your HUD as you hunt monsters.The issue is server overload due to unexpected population. This shows the game's popularity and there are reasons for such hype the first being The reminiscence of the 90's childhood RPG when games were actually hard and it felt immensely satisfying to accomplish tasks. Monster Hunter (MH) series in the past has been as punishing as the Dark Souls series. However in this new edition there is autosave that is just the quality of life improvement that any games should have by now. For those familiar with the MH series quests no longer require deposits that would not be refunded should you fail the objectives resulting in smoother progression and you won't have to constantly farm investigations for cash in order to try your strategies with a new monster only to fail and be stuck in a loop. Materials that you picked up during the hunt remains with you even if the session is failed hence you don't have to worry about breaking parts and losing everything when you are proven unworthy.The customisation features are not too complex until you lose track of what you're trying to make but yet sets you apart from others. AND OH MY GOD THE PALICO CUSTOMISATION! YOU GET YOUR OWN PERSONALISED CATTTT!! The graphics and physics on Havoc engine keeps you immersed in the fantasy world. The lighting is a tad bit on the bright side but that just adds to the dreaminess.For those who are into the tough gameplay and are not getting what they want fret not you just haven't progressed far enough. The material farming for Low Rank is developed for casual players and the High Rank is where new game plus begins. High Rank materials required for armors and weapons stays true to the MH series where 6 12 monster captures would be required to complete the entire set depending on RNG sus. Monsters have more movesets and are somewhat less predictable in enrage mode somewhat good enough for some occasional hiccups. Ahem. Elder retreats set skill bonuses charms etc makes the game feels more complete and satisfies your theorycrafting needs to a certain extent.All in all the game is well polished so far have yet to encounter any bugs. A very successful port being keyboard and mouse friendly and controller friendly with very smooth transition of interface button layout that allows the PC master race to swap between their controllers and K&amp M seamlessly during gameplay without having to exit the game.

1571,"2018-08-11",0,0,37,0,1,I really enjoy this game. If you're wondering it is so much more fun and engaging than its free to play alternative Dauntless.This game is beautiful if you have a relatively good PC that being said it does not look great on lower graphics settings and lacks the option to turn off some graphic settings in an effort to increase performance (e.g. motion blur). Additionally you might need to mess around with fullscreen settings because the game likes to launch in windowed Big Picture mode. You'll probably also want to turn off VSYNC.Play the assigned quests (story line quests) solo. For now the multiplayer system is very finicky when playing these for the first time. Once you and your friends have played through the story quests once multiplayer works fine. It also works fine for the other quest modes. It is a bit of a disappointment but ultimately the story quests are only a small portion of the game.Combat system is good cats are obviously great. Character creation is pretty good. It is very satisfying to kill a big ol' dino monster.Though there are problems I am recommending it because it's fun and I can work with its flaws for now.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD,1,

1577,"2018-08-11",0,0,49,0,1,"So the main complaint seems to be about the port. Keep in mind that the game itself got a 90 on metacritic. I'm close to 15 hours in and it is clear why. The combat feels great the open world is beautiful and there are not enough games like this on PC. TIPS Turn off volumenteric fog use a controller (I know this will turn people off from the game but form what I understand the kb/m controls are feeling clunky and on a controller this game does not feel this way). The co op is to help people progress to where you are and to do expeditions (which are really important for gear and the ""grindy"" aspect of the game). Also after you complete the story chapters the game will not kick you out during the story cutscenes. This is not a port thing it is how it was on console and how the creators intended it to be. They want you to have the story cutscenes when you're by yourself. Overall it is a unique fun game but the PC port isn't ideal if you were hoping to use PC controls. I still play ds3 with a controller and either way this seems like a controller worthy game (for me). If that is not a problem I highly recommend it. Also this is currently the fastest selling game on steam of 2018. There is no chance that it will not get more work and be further optimized. I'm just glad I get the chance to play it even though I'm a PC gamer.",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD,1,

1585,"2018-09-08",0,0,121,0,1,Really fun game. Played non stop so far. It's my first game from the series and while it takes a while to adjust to the combat/hunt and crafting gimmicks one you have a clear understanding of how at least half of the things work you will surely get hooked.Just to make things clear. If you are in to realy fast paced action combat where the hero can rip through the enemies with flashy combos this might not be the game for you. The game revolves around tactic and analysis of the combat situation you are in and espacialy using items. If you come from more traditional action combat games using items might seem as cheating at first but it is a core mechanic of the game and it is actually encouraged (if you don't want to have a really hard time).Overall really great game for those who are looking for something a bit differemt then the norm on pc.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD,1,
1586,"2018-08-23",1,1,101,0,0,The game itself is somewhat enjoyable. The builds are varied and flexible. The gameplay itself is pretty challenging and satisfying. However this feels like a pretty lazy PC port. The mouse isn't well utilized I could use a controller but I'd really rather not. There isn't really an option to use the mouse to control the direction of your swings and strafing is irritiating.There is also no ultra wide screen support for the game.Aside from the other complaints the inability to play multiplayer is the main reason why this game isn't 1 for me. It's frustrating trying to get a group together to play only to have every player D/C from the match with no way to rejoin the party.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD,1,

Constant disconnects SOS flare system is You have to see the cut scene then DC from ur quest and then join ur friend? No skipping cut scenes either. I feel like the game would be much more fun if i could join and play co op without all the BS. Also all fights seem scripted. If im in a lobby with a friend and we DC the exact same things will happen in each of our lobbies at the same time same kill time aswell even with different weapons and upgrades.All monsters have the exact same cycles if they have armor they will re armor 3 times and if not they just heal. Eventually they sleep in the last cycle and then you kill it. Really fun game Kappa. It look cool and everything but it's just reskinned monsters and doing boring tedious monsters over and over again.PS.

1592,"2018-08-13",0,0,180,0,1,"This game looks beautiful.CAPCOM defiitely made a beautiful game but with that being said it takes quite the machine to run it at high/max settings. Many of the people complaining about it being a poorly optimized port are correct in that it is poorly optimized in comparison to other AAA titles. It takes much more processing power from both your GPU and CPU to hold a steady 60 fps than other games but the amount of effects and details in the game make it apparent as to why it is as such.Pick this game up if you were on the fence about it but be warned that without a newer/higher end PC you may be dropping your graphics settings lower than you would in other games to achieve 60 fps.Also to note this game was probably optimized to run 30 fps which could be the reason so many people are having trouble getting it to 60 fps. I have read that many people on lower end machines run it fine 30 fps with higher graphics settings so keep in mind that 30 fps may be where you need to play it at. Note Running a i7 6700k 4.5 Ghz w/ a GTX 1080 2100 Mhz core clock. Getting on average 60 fps with all max settings except volumentric fog (which is set to ""variable""). Going further and setting ""SH Diffuse"" to ""Medium"" from ""High"" gives around 10+ fps boost.",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD,1,

1594,"2018-08-19",0,0,111,0,1,The following review is made by a mostly solo player.With that out of the way I love this game. Beginning this year when I saw this game was going to be on pc I couldn't wait to play it (but ofcourse i needed to wait). When the game released on consoles I searched for my pc version. But i found out that the pc version was to release later way later. Thinking this game was going to release late autumn. But waiting was not going to be as long as anyone expected. Instead of late autumn it released 9 aug. Here is where most people start saying the game is bad but does no one know the game should have released later? Be happy you can play it now. enjoy its in depth melee and ranged combat system. Investigate track and hunt those amazing monsters. I didn't know how long the story would be (story ends ofcourse after the credits not after the first really big monster) but i still was surprised with the length. I finished the story with 73 hours and this ofcourse has some weapon and armor farming that only some people do. But you are really going to need those high rarity weapons and armor.But the bad things about the early release should also be said. Multiplayer is not perfect some players say they can never connect and others (like me when helping a SOS) don't have that many problems at all. Ofcourse solo players won't have problems with this as much as other players. Graphics are also not the best. I personally think there is nothing wrong with them but don't expect amazing 4k textures. Also in late game areas there will be monsters with big attacks. Some people (including me) get minor framedrop when all special attacks take place at once and again some players report this more than others.If you are thinking about buying this game let me tell you this. If you don't refund games all the time you can refund a game if you played it less than 2 hours. This means you can sort of try this game for free for 2 hours. If you are thinking about this method be advised when I really started to play already 80 minutes past. this ofcourse is different for all people. if you go through the character customization quickly you will have more time to try out the game.If you for some reason already have the game and are reading this for fun. please post a review (positive please). With that current 41% rating this game might be abandoned without anything fixed! So please post something!,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD,1,

1605,"2018-08-09",0,0,13,0,1,To anyone new to the series I've got a small section outlined in the review for an overview towards the end the short start mainly covers the port. An excellent port that runs exceptionally well on a R9 390 overclocked with an i7 6700k at max settings 1080p. An SSD makes load times an absoloute dream especially when compared to the PS4's.The game's not my favorite in the series in terms of content but it's still the best in terms of accessibility design and quality. Logged around 350 hours in the PS4 release and I'm likely going to log another 200 or so in the PC release. For New Comers Monster Hunter World marks the first time a Monster Hunter game has come to PC barring the subpar MMO Monster Hunter Online and I believe earlier versions of Monster Hunter Frontier. It also marks the first time the game's been released off of the 3DS in almost 3 generations of games. The core gameplay loop is somewhat hard to describe the appeal of as on the surface it seems like Grinding The Game but in reality Monster Hunter is a massively succesful genre defining series based around learning the behaviours of gargantuan monsters. The core gameplay loop features you deciding on a set of equipment you want to make hunting a monster to make said equipment and then deciding on a new set. Where the actual fun of that loop comes from is just how the gameplay works each monster is a formidable opponent who acts as a sort of boss fight but a boss fight where the health bar is how the boss starts to limp about drool and go look for food and a boss who you can break the body parts off of to gain a much easier time fighting. The games always do an excellent job of conveying these monsters being actual creatures instead of giant punching bags and that's more true than ever in World. Add onto the phenomenal monsters with 14 entirely unique and complex weapons that can take upwards of 20 hours to truly master and you've got yourself a winning formular. From the slow methodical lance that can block even the beefiest of hits (lance is bae) to the powerful high risk high reward greatsword all the way to the GOTTA GO FAST spindash dual blades each weapon is as complex if not moreso than the monsters themselves. also brachydios is the best monster and it's a crime that the glowy fist punchman isn't in World.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD,1,
1606,"2018-08-28",0,0,105,0,0,"I'd love to give this game a positive review but.. I simply cannot.Monster Hunter is a video game made by Capcom. Infamous for their weird controls which are also making a come back in this poor excuse of a port.Anyone below the absolute top end PC brigade should stay away from this game for a few simple reasons. The optimalisation could be compared to the one of Dark Souls 1 top tier PCs struggling to keep up 30 fps on the lowest settings. What is '1' for the game is the bare minimum to run it on somewhere around 30 frames a second. The amount of graphical options is laughable you do not even have essentials such as Field of View. The game is plainly..Ugly cannot put it in another words for the specs it requires you to have. If I'm meant to shell out thousands of dollars for an absolute top tier PC I'd at least like a game to match.However let's say you've got the gear to match the game's ridicolous desires and can manage a 60fps without lag spikes.. Well then enjoy an awful GUI and key mapping.I'm just going to add this candy here The default key to aim is the letter V..Did anyone even test it before release?Then you have the majestic issue of not even being able to change what the controls are for things such as..Sprinting!Connection issues that make it literally impossible to play the game with not only friends but most of the time strangers.And here's my problem. The game is splendid for it's gameplay but I cannot enjoy it when one of the monsters reduces my frame rate to zero everytime it decides to do a couple of certain attacks which apparently it follows by a ""ZA WARUDO"" because my game freezes for a while everytime they do.",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD,1,

I also HIGHLY recommend playing this with a controller.Loving the combat and weapon choices really like the fact you can swap gear and weapons at any time (from your campsite tent) for whatever situations you encounter.Sure the game has bugs what game doesn't for years now. I have high hope they will fix issues as they release the planned content updates (and of course hotfixes as soon as possible for major issues like server stability) and whatnot. Look how fast they fixed the CPU crash bug that was present when early press/streamer versions were released.I can't wait to get all the events and content updates that are currently on the console version and beyond.Advice To get a huge boot to fps Turn off Volume Rendering Quality in the advanced graphics settings.

As for should you buy the game If you have the computer for it absolutely. Most of the downvotes are because of Denuvo connection problems and the mouse input.

I don't usually pay this extortionate price for games unless I am really excited for them ! I was hyped for this game ever since I saw it... but sadly I can't recommend it in the current state.Cons Very Poor OptimisationI've lowered the graphics down quite low gpu usage around 70% !The game is jittery and the FPS fluctuates a lot from the fixed 60 I had it at down to 15/20 at times ! Mouse Lag / Acceleration problemsThere's no option to disable mouse acceleration. When moving the mouse there is a slight delay. Connection IssuesWithin less than an hour of playing the game disconnected from the servers... Blue Screen of DeathMoments after the disconnection blue screen of death. Monster attacking seems very bland.I wanted to be running up monsters and having epic fights !Nope ... nothing more than a very simple hack and slash.. only you don't really ""feel"" the combat as you do with many other games. Graphics aren't that amazing.In all fairness even with Max graphics I didn't feel they were anything special for a 2018 game. Which brings to question what's affecting the FPS because my GPU was only at 70% load.Pros + Character customisation is immense.I will be getting a full refund on this game it is unplayable in it current state.If it was a 1/5th of the price it currently is I would have given it time to improve... but considering it's current price it is definitely not worth keeping.I'm sorry but I can not recommend this game.",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD,1,

1653,"2018-08-10",0,0,239,0,1,I love this game. Looks and runs fine on my machine with the exception of 1 specific elder dragon that throws tornados everywhere near death and drops my fps to about 50 from a (mostly) solid 60 fps. Load times... What are they?I have not had any disconnect issues in the last 35 hours of playtime so I can safely say matchmaking is fixed as opposed to how the game released. Co op/Multiplayer seems a little confusing at first but after playing around with it it's super simple.I highly recommend this game if you like Dark Souls style combat albeit in a more whimsical colouful world crafting gear and grinding badass monsters for material drops.Now that free content is starting to drop I can definitely recommend this game.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD,1,
1654,"2018-09-01",0,0,59,0,1,First of all my overall score will be a 7/10 out of a possible 9/10.Skipping over the fact that online multiplayer didnt really work for a few days I've had zero issues technologically speaking so far. No crashes no black screens etc what I've heard other people having issues with (other than the variety of loading times at opening the game wich doesnt take that long).Overall comparing this with other Monster hunter games like 3U F/4U F/Generations X this itteration of the game is lacking in monster variety ( the boss monsters ). The other console games ussualy brought quite a few monsters from game to game like MH 3U they brought a few to MH 4U and like that expanded their reportoire of monsters. On a side note this is a new Console/PC game thats FULL HD! where i assume they had to remake a lot and or create entirely new HD sprites and animations for this game. For this ill forgive the lack of diversity hoping in upcomming DLC's there will be more to come. ( and hoping they are free as every other MH game in the last.... forever years but well see).One reason that this game is getting one downpoint from me is the lowering of required skill level to actually play the game. I'm not an Elite or someone whos awefully good at the game but once I've started the older games I've died quite a few times trying to fight monsters and getting to know their weaknesses etc. Now tho I've died zero times during the Low rank missions... wich says something not about me becomming EPIC or amazing but about them lowering the difficulty ( no more self tracking or using paintballs to track monsters you can now do it easy and for free no more self exploring monsters weaknesses because afther you kill em once or twice the game does it for you). I can get over this fact that they made it more easyer and accesable to the general public but for me a long time MH player it feels like something is lacking but i can get over it.Next up graphically speaking this is the best MH game I've seen so far in terms of looks ( havent played the JP games like G or F ) but hoped there would be a new weapon type but that would take ages to develop and think about ( maybe explosive boxing gloves? RWBY anyone? or &gt _&gt Doubly shields! gimmy! ).This game will cost quite a bit of time to complete everything 100% but its worth the effort and you ussualy directly see the stuff that effort gets you.Finnaly if you like MH in general youll like this game and ill reccomend getting it both on sale and not it isnt really a game that gives you a headstart if your early since people will help you out it isnt really compettetive unless you want that world reccord for slaying the biggest mosters the fastest ).Note... there are cat genital like and plenty of funny helmets and gear to go around attaining! that alone makes this game worthwile.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD,1,
1655,"2018-08-11",0,0,59,0,1,Fantasic game really good port + man... it's a goddamn Monster Hunter itself. The first ever on PC. I've been enjoying this game for many hours (still like hundreds+ to play) but seeing Mixed reviews kinda makes me sad. Why mixed reviews in the first place? Probably because many people who ing love this game are playing and not wasting their time on forum. A lot of people play this game at the same time (almost 300k) and many people encounter some problems. I personally have ecountered like 3 the game doesn't run on 1920x1080 (little black strapes on left and right) sometimes strange errors pop up when I alt tab my game and the last thing some textures are pretty low resolution (probably gonna get fixed sooner or later.Stable framerate plays really good on mouse and keyboard many translantions free DLCs heaven like soundtrack BEAUTIFUL graphics and the mother ing godlike amazing gameplay. I'm not a die hard Monster Hunter fan but it really feels great to play it on PC instead of your little 3DS. Some people say it's too hard yeah it's Monster Hunter not a game directed for casuals but still it's the easiest Monster Hunter ever so many new people in the series shouldn't get lost (but gonna struggle a lot though). Easily one of the best game (if not the best one) of the recent years.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD,1,
1656,"2018-08-09",0,0,0,0,0,"Well Capcom did not dissapointed me once again I was prepared to see a bad port and I'm not surprised to see that this was the case. Let me explain 1. The controller don't work but hey we are on PC so use Joy2pad or Xpadder and now you can use your controller.... off to a great start huh ?2. So I tested the keyboard and it said press ""m"" to open the map not working so I said to myself ""oh wait is the game so bad that it can't tell if I have an AZERTY or a QWERTY keyboard ?"" I press "" "" and the map opened..... yet when it says WASD to move QZSD works fine..... 3. The game is not very optimized cutscenes have some stutter and in game I tend to lag when I'm way above the requirement I know that this game requiere a lot of CPU but I have a good processor or else my GTX 1080 Ti is not enough for this good but it should.4. Can't change the settings in game ? Must restart the game everytime ? The first time I saw that cutscenes had problems I decided to close the game and decided to disable stuff that would be problematic and set most graphics on medium even if the store page says that I should be good on high if I had a lower setting so what my PC is too good for the game ? Does the game want me to play on console or something ? 5. Some people can't even play the game because the game crash for them that was not my case but that's a thing that can happen.I'm new to monster hunter so I was not very hyped for this game but if someone waited 6+ month for this game to come on PC and see that the game is a very bad port he/she will be very mad so many months in order for Capcom to ""make a good port"" and we got the usual Capcom stuff.... the store is already filled with cosmetics and stuff so you know what is the priority for Capcom. So yeah this is a pretty bad port. Well sounds like I won't join the monster hunter fanclub and it's a good thing that I can refund games via steam (A moment of silence for those who can't refund the game because they have bought a key on a website) I'll pre order Valkyrie chronicles 4 with the refund. If you don't know if the game will even work for you try it and if it doesn't work refund it so don't spend 2 hours on the very basic character screen.",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD,1,
1657,"2018-08-13",0,0,127,0,1,Have been waiting for a Monster Hunter game to hit the PC ever since a friend 1 me the series back when Monster Hunter 2 had been out for a year or two.Can honestly say... the wait was worth it.Pros The Graphics are amazing. (Yes they are on par with the console but that does not take away from the experience at all!) Minimal loading times. (1 3 Seconds at most!) Runs well on a 17 4790k with a GTX 980 and 16GB Ram (Stable locked 60 FPS). Palico character creation. (Sadly you can't play as a Palico!) The ability to completely solo the game OR play with up to 3 friends / randoms depending on your preference. Tons of Gear and Weapons to craft with more being added later down the line. Pet collection. (Probably doesn't matter to a few but I know quite a few pet hoarders in other games like WoW and Pokemon) Multiple ways to play the game with 14 weapons types. 3 Character slots meaning even more ways to play. And tons more!Cons As of right now there are a few people suffering with server issues. It is unclear if it steam servers (as people go online and offline before they disconnect) or whether its Capcom. ( I personally have only suffered 1 DC in the time I've played in 15+ Hours) The mouse can feel a little sluggish and can compare to a controller joystick. (Again I have no issue with this doesn't distract me from play at all) Menus could be improved for PC play but there are ways to alleviate some of the problems by using Radial Menu Type 2 aswell as rebinding certain keys. Talking of keybindings... you WILL need to rebind them especially as ranged. V to aim and Ctrl to shoot... not exactly ideal. As of 13/08/18 there is no 21 9 support (I play 1920x1080 at 16 9).Extra My advice? Turn off Volumetric Rendering it is an FPS killer! Take reviews with a grain of salt if you truly love the MH series it is a FUN game to play with player count reaching over 320k at around 2PM BST (UK time) where as negative reviews (Currently at 13/08/18) is at 12 885. and postiive reviews being at 11 328. Total reviews standing at 24 213. Hardly a great sample size. Price is a little steep so that might be a turn off for quite a few people. If you're afraid of the Cons then please do wait for the sale as Capcom would have probably solved most if not all of the issues by then.Overall I'd give the game an 8/10. I love it to hell and back and time flies with it but I simply can't give it a 9/10+ until ALL issues have been solved for my fellow gamers even if I myself haven't suffered from many problems in the time I've played.Edit It seems that most of the issues listed above have been solved.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD,1,

1659,"2018-09-26",0,0,535,0,1,I have to write this positive recommendation because the earlier negatives were due to the online connection problems. I am happy to say that they are not present in the game anymore (or only happen very rarely). There is no obstacle now to play a good online session with your friends or with strangers.The game is about fighting big monsters collecting materials to build weapons and armors and then fight even bigger monsters and every such fight is similar to a serious boss fight in other games! Maybe this gameplay seems dull or monotone but really the monsters are so diverse detailed and unique that it is a real joy to fight them. You can play it in single player too but I personally find the hunt much more enjoyable (and easier) while I am playing in multiplayer.And I almost forgot the developers always keep adding new content for free!,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD,1,

If that wasn't frustrating enough the game wont let me join my brother's session or even show him as online. As a normal person with a full time job having only sparing time here and there to play this is completely unacceptable on top of that I paid 60 dollars for this. Capcom needs to step up and fix this unplayable piece of garbage.Another thing I do not understand is the lack of ultrawide support being such a prominent part of PC gaming makes this choice again unexcussable.

1665,"2018-08-13",0,0,30,0,0,Good game but this port is absolute and Capcom should be ashamed of themselves for releasing it in its current state.Here's some examples of what makes it so bad It doesn't even open on some occassions forcing you to completely exit steam and try again. This bug occurred for me the first time I tried to boot the game. Horrific netcode. Count yourself lucky if you can even get into an online session. More often than not the game will out an error code when you try to either join an SOS or get into lobby with other players. If you do somehow manage to join a quest then you'd be best be on your toes because you're sure as not safe from disconnects there. The occasional error code is expected now and again there's no real issue with that but when it's happening every single time you try to get into a lobby or join a quest it becomes inexcusable. Finding a multilpayer quest with other people is abysmal. There's two hundred and fifty thousands players currently in game as of writing this but you'll still struggle to find even one session or SOS quest for the monster you're looking to farm. Now this wouldn't be so bad if you could just refresh the stagnant quest/lobby pool like you can in most muliplayer games. But you can't. In order to look for another SOS or lobby you have to go all the way back to the main menu and find another session and then hope to God you have luck then. Why Capcom?Those are just a few examples I've found. I'm certain I'll be adding to more to the list the more I play (if I even can get any further). It's a good game definitely but this port is straight out of the dump and needs a lot of fixes and fast. If you wanna buy it still and don't mind soloing most of everything then be my guest and add it to your library. Be prepared for frustration though.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD,1,

Despite the game being clear about how to do stuff it is still quite difficult to put it in to your compulse with the new stuff things can get even additionaly difficult(That navigation ugh...).

1678,"2018-08-10",0,0,98,0,1,This is a game where you are left to discover most of the things and skills all by yourself it doesn't spoon feed you with a lot of information.And that is the beautiful of Monster Hunter you have to discover and learn things by yourself.You might keep failing on killing certain monsters ( or not ) but that's the main point of the game difficulty hunting monsters. I have spent an hour creating my character and palico. Though they could've added more hairstyles but I guess I don't care about this as much.Kept trying most of the weapons to find one that suits me and have went with dual blade.

And even with low graphics it looks amazing.( decided to wait until I have my pc with me to play the fps count for my laptop is too bad for this to be played with comfort )# if you dislike grinding over and over again do yourselves a favour and save the money.80/100 because of the lack of hairstyles.

I just can't.Here is original review Story 5/10 not much to say its pretty straight forward and linear.Gameplay 12/10 Skill based combat and smart monster A.I. with interesting mechanics per weapon.Replayability 20/10 If you could spend thousands of hours on one weapon and spend thousands more on another. Weapon and monster mastery is your goal here. Create whatever build you want and see if its good for speed runs or group runs on harder monsters.This game will forever have mixed reviews because its not a game for everyone. Its a game for people who like a good hunt. If you want PvP go play csgo rainbow6seige or PUBG. This game is for the hardcore PvE gamer who likes to release some steam after a hard day and beat up monsters to thier heart's content.

The GRIND good lord the grind somtimes you will be lucky and get a whole armor set and weapon from a monster after killing it a mere 4 times and other times you could be looking at a number closer to 10 or 15 which is alot considering these monsters can take up to 20 minutes to kill or capture. Then there's the rare like gems 3% drop chance doesn't sound right to me no matter what you say. Some really frustrating design desicions espesially when just starting with the game ""oh you just died to the monster ? here's half your max health back goodluck !"" That very old fashioned mission completion screen telling you how well you did and all the you got after every godamn mission would have liked a skip all and take all option. Trying to play through the campaign with a friend is awkard as hell you'll see why. Game has some very cheap difficulty spikes you spend half an hour fighting a monster dodging and blocking all its heavily telegraphed attacks even when they do hit you it does very little damage and all of a sudden the monster randomly tramples in a certain direciton taking 60 % of your health and staggering your character leaving you incapable of defending yourself for the next 7 seconds. For a game called Monster Hunter there's a luaghably little amount of actual hunting you wander randomly untill you find a footprint or some mucis and then your magical super tracker glowing buggs do the rest while all you have to do is follow like a child you will spend more time looking at these eyesores than any monster in the game. Zorah Migdora is trash garbage the fact that they make you do that boss multiple times is beyond insulting. The ridiculous farm for powercreep is completly unjustified as even barely average gear is capable of getting you through every challenge the game has to offer and since there's no competitive element to the game I dont know why people minMax so much.One of the best games I've ever played no doubt 9/10 dont take any of my negatives personaly I have always been better at seeing whats wrong with a game instead of whats great about it and this is all MY OPINION!",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD,1,

1714,"2018-12-21",0,0,19,0,0,This is not a pc game this a playstation port and very poor at that. Controls do not work with typical PC standard controls.As for the game itself in a nuthsell you pay 60 for dated graphics poor controls and camera work and lack of variety of activities to do.The essence of the game is that you chase bullet spongy monsters around you kill them over and over until you gathered enaugh materials for a new set of equipment rince repeat.There are many issues that I don't reallly have the strenght to rant about like poor hitboxes loading times etc you should be wary of those too.I'm not going to complain about the weapons being clunky and slow because they're oversized and you can learn to work around that fact it is probably the most enjoyable part of the game. That is learning your combos and animation lenghts.In perticular I like the hammer and the switchaxe despite being slow at first you learn that they're really fluid... but your character wont turn for some reason. And it's always like that with this game always something wrong.I had great trouble hitting my targets thanks to defualt camera settings which are terrible just tinkering with the camera to work more like it does on actual PC games instead of consoles will improve the experience slightly but it's nowhere near what it's SUPPOSED to be for a working pc game.After all said and done this game is not worth 60 bucks. It's a game with dated graphics and very limited gameplay with little variety and annoying console UI for a full price.At best this game is worth maybe 25 e and I'mbeing REALLY generous here.Be wary Steam won't let me refound this game make sure this is exactly what you wantbecause you won't be getting your money back I will be making business elswere I guess form now on.The tutorial alone is 2 hours long and does not represent the game properly instead youre mostly stuck in cutscenes and don't get to play.SO the 2 hour rule on top of dealing with terrible UI is insanely short time to make a decision. BE ware of that fact to me it's a deliberate scam.Also something noteworthy about this game is that it is not an MMO it's a lobby based co op game. TO be fair it's not advertised as an MMO just something to keep in mind.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD,1,

1717,"2018-12-23",0,0,201,0,1,Game is quite a bit better than it was at launch a lot of the performance and disconnect issues have been fixed although disconnects still happen for seemingly no reason. C'mon Capcom. Combat is pretty fun and is generally high risk/high reward with an emphasis on anticipating (or at least remembering) attacks/patterns. At times can be incredibly frustrating but the satisfaction of finally downing the monster you've been attempting for the past 2 hours is definitely worth it. Future battles against said monster generally result in incresingly optimal strategies and before long the monster is naught but a speed bump on the road to new weapons and armor.The story is forgettable at best and really only serves to pace the introduction of new monsters of which I'd prefer there were more of since a few just feel like reskins of another.Overall definitely worth it if you enjoy the style of gameplay and aren't looking for a decent story.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD,1,

The thing about this game that makes it so special to me is the monsters and how they each have their own personalities and can see this not only when we fight them but also if you just follow them around the world and watch how the monsters interact with the environment and each other for example if you follow Kulu Ya Ku around the wildspire wast you will see him seal an Apceros egg then full on sprint back to his nest to eat it every now and then he will run past the Apceros whilst running only for them to stare at Kulu like he is the literal embodiment of the devil and start yelling what I can only assume is CHRIST COMPELLES YOU whenever Kulu s around. And the thing is every monster has its own little routine that you can observe as you follow them. That is why I would 100% recommend this game.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD,1,

Then after some update in late 2015 it became unplayable for me. Constant disconnects and rubber banding plague every match I've tried since then and I've tried many hours as my time played shows. I have tried every method I could find to remedy but nothing has worked even tried a different ISP and couple differents routers (even though I play many other online games without any problems). The problems lie with the game and poor servers as many many people can attest. Once the game is playable for me once again and this won't be a negative review.P.S.

1758,"2018-07-08",0,0,1169,0,1,One of the best game I have ever played. I will never stop loving to play this as it's challenging and forces you get better every single time you play. The only way to dislike this game is to play mindlessly hoping to eventually get better and complaining about it being laggy or teammates being awful. I will agree that the servers are not always perfect and sometimes the balls clip but in the end if you're skilled enough and actively trying to be better you will have a lot of fun. I will also agree that whom you play with is important but as long as you don't do too many mistakes and take the opportunities that you're presented with you'll do just fine most of the time.,Rocket League®,1,

Playing this game you'll find yourself going through phases. SunlessKhan on youtube has a great video about this titled ""every rocket league player."" Very accurate. You'll start out having loads of fun as you laugh at yourself trying to get a grip on the mechanics. Then you'll move on to a bit of frustration once you feel as though you should be playing better but you're getting smashed by people flying through the air. So you spend time learning how to move through the air efficiently. You'll feel a bit of pride followed by ever more frustration as you continue to get smashed by ceiling shots and pristine positioning. So you'll learn how to do ceiling shots and improve positioning. You'll win some and feel great. Then you'll get smashed by flicks elite dribble control and fakes. Rinse. And. Repeat. There is no ceiling on improvement in this game. You can ALWAYS get better.

1898,"2016-09-04",0,0,480,0,1,I only have about 20 hours of gameplay at the moment for this game but I have enjoyed every moment of it.From figuring out the first few flips to making simple goals and finally pulling off some simplistic air goals (nothing feels better than that). One thing I feel so far about this game is that it is simple to grasp yet there is a very high skill level if you're willing to keep trying new crazy moves and work on your accuracy as well as teamwork. Teamwork may not seem too important until you start getting closer to the elite division matches you learn very quickly that it is not always about scoring a goal but also setting up your teammates to score.In any case I highly suggest trying this game out even at the $20 price tag and especially if it ever goes on sale.One extra note concerning the cross play aspect between the PC and the Playstation. You can get into randomized matches with either type players however you can only intentionally get into a private match with a friend that is on a different system at the moment (e.g. if you're on the PC and your friend is on a Playstation you must create a match and they must join you). Additionally through this method you cannot play the typical ranked/unranked online matches only against other friends or computers.*Edit If you cannot stand games that Give you the cold sweats Cause you to RageButtClench Force you to panic Periodically disallows blinking Gives way too much sense of accomplishment...you may want to avoid this game**Edit I now have a little over 97 hours of gameplay and still feel the same way about this game. The matches now have become far more difficult since my friends and I have been ranking up but it makes it all the more fun. After a certain point you truly do have to rely on everyone on your team to know how to Make contact with the ball in the air Play as goalie Be an aggressive striker Work as a team many goals come from passing to a teammate***Edit (188 Hours)What? You still have not tried this game yet?,Rocket League®,1,

1903,"2017-02-22",0,0,389,0,1,Rocket League is a fun and unique game where you play soccer but with a TWIST... you play with CARS! In Rocket League you can play ranked or unranked which is a ranking system from the highest rank to the lowest rank. You can get items to customize your car and even get different types of cars such as a boost wheels topper(hat) and many different skins and for the items you dont want you can trade with other players to get something better or if you have 5 of the same type of item ( Common Uncommon Rare Very Rare Import Body Exotic And of course mystery decal) then you can trade it in for one item of a higher rarity. But beware of scammers! You can also train in the exhibiton or go there just for some fun! You can also buy crates which is a random item which could possibly be a mystery decal. And it's under 20$!!!! I definitely recommend this to anyone that like soccer or cars or BOTH and even if you dont like those 2 things it's still a really good game and i highly recommend you check it out NOW!!!,Rocket League®,1,

I didnt expect for this game to instantly become one of my favorites but i was way wrong. This is one of the best games i have ever played! if you are new and bad (like i was) rocket leauges matchmaking will accually put you with people of your skill level unlike SOME GAMES who claim they do. I have owned this game for four days now and i already have 14 hours in it. For a comparrison I have owned CS GO for 2 years play it regurally and i only have 15 hours invested in this game.

Casual or Harcore player both can play this game You can always improve in this game ALWAYS (Even pros does) Esport tournaments (everybody can join) Super friendly for new comers HUD and control are easy to learn but not to master. Great to play with friends!!!! Any Controllers can be used on PC Trading cosmetics Private matches/Mini Tournaments Very Good matchmaking in ranked 99% of the time I've played in ranks it's against people of the same skill level as I. Any other game modes it's against random ranks. Good season rewards Not P2W the best car overall is a free one. Great community in generalCons There's maybe a ton of extra game modes but you won't play 20 games back to back of one game mode. (Becomes boring in my opinion) Repetitive it's not the same actions or the same decisions that you are making over and over but the gameplay is always the same. Microtransactions Rocket league didn't have them in the first year that i've played. It was a very good year but since they launch it I feel they put all their efforts on cosmetics and events around them.. they still do provide new content but it's just new game modes and like I said before most of the time after 5 games you are going back to normal mode. They do give 5 free keys every events for players that plays the game in that period that item that you unlock cannot be trade with other players because you got it for free. Sometimes it can be hard to play in other regions. (Pings/Packet loss/ETC) People didn't had problems before some patches ago. Since you play cross platform it's weird when a Ps4 or Xbox can get only 30 FPS but PC is uncapped. That's the main reason why I enjoy playing more on PC then PS4. (I see the difference) Bad rewards overall beside the season rewards and the free keys the game doesn't give you meaning or nice rewards. Maybe I have a lot of cons but the game is very very good I would suggest it to anyone. Everybody can play it and it's just a very fun game. I'm gonna have plenty more hours on it!Hope this rewiew was helpfull ),Rocket League®,1,

It's great for both the competitive and casual gamer as anybody can pick this game up and have a great time and at the same time there is a huge skill scale for this game.

1928,"2018-12-20",0,0,496,0,1,"My playtime says it all but I have some very important remarks to makeThis game has some fantastic physics letting you pull off some incredible tricks and making it a great multiplayer matchmaking online experience. I spent hours playing four seasons of Rocket League and I had a lot of fun with the Competitive and Casual modes.However I am going to criticize some choices regarding the matchmaking and the crate unlocking systems. The matchmaking system is very inconsistent. I spent the majority of my playtime in Standard Gold III and oh boy I played in lots of crazy matches with own goals left right and everywhere and unimaginable whiffs. Granted I'm not the pinnacle of Rocket League skills but I at least learned how to rotate and rotation was what made me reach Gold III and ironically made me get stuck in Gold III. If you want to be promoted further I give you two choices find a party to play with or start grinding skills like a madman. I highly recommend the former option because the latter is only 1 for those who want to go for e sports and I am pretty sure you have lots more games than Rocket League.The Crate unlocking system is pretty inconsistent as well. You see It doesn't matter if you buy keys or earn decryptors for free the roulette will have always the same random chances of giving you items. The difference between keys and decryptors is that the items you get with decryptors you can't trade with other players. My question is Why? The guy who bought the key is already having an instant opportunity to get an item while the guy who goes for decryptors have to sporadically get one through playtime. I think this kind of design choice discourage trading.And now let's address the big elephant in the room the in game online community. When I was being promoted from Bronze I until Silver III I had very few instances of toxic people and I was also able to do some friends. Heck there was this guy who gently 1 me to learn about rotation it was wonderful time. However starting from Gold I things got very chaotic and I became toxic myself through ironic ""Nice Shot!"" and ""What a Save!"" Quick chat messages. I am very ashamed of what I have done. So again if you are going to play Competitive I highly recommend finding friends to play with. Unfortunately you can't make crossplatforms parties which Psyonix is supposedly working through Rocket ID (which is being delayed constantly don't count on it) only Steam parties are possible.In conclusion wonderful game questionable matchmaking system and crate unlocking toxic community proportional to rank. If you want to experience it I also recommend starting with Casual before going to Competitive.",Rocket League®,1,

Taught me to the best way to win is to be a and use strategies depriving opponent from their boosts chasing them so you can destroy them and never giving them a chance to defend. Taught me to be ready to hear a lot of when you miss once or make a tiny mistakes because you are not up to your partner's expectations.I like the idea of the game simple controls are a bit difficult with keyboard but it's not the worst the keys to unlock crates are cheap you can get some items even if you are a ftp.

1998,"2019-01-17",0,0,1173,0,1,Rocket League is a incredibly fine tuned and skill based game. Don't worry about RNG ruining your experience because it literally doesn't exist in Rocket League. Additionally Rocket League is very rewarding to those who dedicate their time to furthering their skills. There are tons of mechanics to learn besides jumping flipping and boosting. Every single mechanic has community made training packs which you can complete. The diversity to the game's mechanics are what make it so phenomenal. On the kickoff alone you could boost straight boost and then front flip boost for a while then turn slightly to one direction and side flip boost and jump once and then front flip just above the ground to get a speed boost without actually flipping or yolo it by boosting and turning your car 180 degrees midair before backflipping. Whatever style you want to utilize this game offers it. Buy this game it is more than worth your time.,Rocket League®,1,
1999,"2019-01-17",0,0,324,0,1,Easily one of the best games I have ever played. The game is so clean and fun with little to no glitches or bugs that ruin the experience.

2000,"2019-01-17",0,0,127,0,1,Steam shows 100 hrs of gameplay but I played on Xbox for 3 years prior.This game used to be fun but it just seems kinda blah now.Suffers from a broken matchmaking system. Most matches are extremely unbalanced especially in ranked play where it matters most. Not really that fun when the other team is capable of performing ariels and trick shots while it's all your teammates can do to hold a basic rotation. This is probably my biggest complaint.I also feel like the community is shrinking even with the crossplay updates. Usually I just end up playing with the same 2 3 people at time. Even after requeing.I'd still recommend it to new players but only when it's on a discount. (Highly 1 you play with friends though),Rocket League®,1,

2064,"2017-08-08",0,0,190,0,1,GTA V is an open world sandbox game with a decent story mode but a multiplayer experience that is a bit iffy.Story Mode/Singleplayer has a great story with the 3 protagonists you can play as and is moddable with third party programs such as OpenIV a modding tool which allows people to create player models vehicles and several other additions. Singleplayer alone is a good reason to get this game.Online is just a mess that makes you unsure if you either love it or hate it. Reasons to love it would be that it's one of the best ways to play a sandbox game with friends plus it has quite a few good gamemodes like deathmatches races or jobs which are all enjoyable. Reasons to hate it is that it's VERY grindy to get everything you want like supercars weapons owned property literal fighter jets which are all above GTA$1 000 000. Because it's so grindy players are encouraged to buy Shark Cards with actual money for in game money. Around $55 in real money is $8 000 000 in GTA money which is just SO f**king greedy for Rockstar to do. Sure you can get some sort of business to gain money but even that is slow boring and still grindy. Though if you do want lots of money fast doing heists when you're lv12 and have a high class apartment is the way to go (Alternatively a challenge called 'Criminal Mastermind' rewards you with $10 million IF you play all the heists with the same people and DON'T DIE AT ALL).Overall Singleplayer is great Online is a mess you decide if you want this.

2099,"2017-08-18",0,0,343,0,1,I really recommend this game for those people that like free roaming games such like gta 4 and stuff.if you played this game on console. i thought that some missions on console are not the same as the pc. or it could be that i dont remember the missions on console or it could be that i forgot how the missions are and i was thinking that the missions were defferent. My thoughts on Gta ONLINE are different then the story mode because i dont think that you have a big chance if you dont spend irl money on the game. because either you get killed by a high level player or you get killed my a low level player that has added alot of money into the game and killes you alot. But i really recommend this game to other people that like free roaming games.,Grand Theft Auto V,1,

2133,"2018-06-23",0,0,371,0,1,GTA V is an immensely entertaining game with a very large play area and a great deal to do. Single player wise the story isn't as good as GTA IV in my opinion but it still fun once you get past the first few grind missions and Trevor's character is always quite entertaining. I will say that once the story is done it almost seems like there isn't that much to do but one can still easily put in 20 30 hours into single player. Multiplayer is where the GTA series shines in my opinion and 5 can be quite fun with friends but suffers from a few issues. First connecting to multiplayer services can be painfully slow. Several minutes waits are not uncommon. In addition the multiplayer mission content could be improved and they have been very slow to release additional content that isn't blatent money grabs. Despite these issues once you load in the multiplayer is quite entertaining as you can always find silly things to do with friends. So long as you don't pour additional money into the game you should definitely get your money's worth from it and have a good time.TLDR Solid entry not as good as 4 and could be improved but worth getting,Grand Theft Auto V,1,
2134,"2018-06-23",0,0,50,0,1,Excellent game!

2141,"2015-06-02",0,0,18,0,0,This game is fun however you have to play for at least 3 hrs before you are able to save the game. The game has many glitches to where you will not be able to switch characters. This game is not with the $60 you are going to spend on it. I would not recommend this to any of my friends. At most the game is worth about $20. Also many people are having problems with moding the game.,Grand Theft Auto V,1,
2142,"2015-06-07",0,0,123,0,0,GTA V is the worst game I have ever got on steam it crashes after every mission or during without being able to save your progress making you have to redo entier missions three or four times the loading screen takes ages after rebooting it and it gets longer with each reboot. Sometimes your characters get black lines across their faces and bodies in online and storymode. Recently I came into an issue that GTA V worth 40 doesnt even work as when playing I dont seem to be controlling the character and he just stands there with the only button that works is the esc key then once in the menu of the game all my keys and my mouse work but when I want to play the game it doesnt work. I would rather spend money on any other game as a game full of bugs and crashes is not worth 40. Steam isnt even helpful with the issue as I've spent 1 hour trying to go on steam forums and trying to report the bugs and it just redirects me and tells me stuff like 'reboot your computer' I have about 4 times and I've rebooted steam but it doesnt work so dont ever buy this game on PC as it is one of the worst games ever on PC.P.S Also I bought this game for the mods and now you cannot mod this game so do not buy.,Grand Theft Auto V,1,

The subsequent minutes long loading times are also a massive pain in the proverbial but GTA Online could have been an amazing idea if only Take 2/Rockstar let us hold our own private sessions so then we didn't have to deal with the rampent hacking.Also removing the main modding tool for your game via a DMCA no less!! is just PR suicide and I'm glad it's showing in the ratings maybe then blinded companies will see what happens if you attack a fan base that has supported your games for over 10 years will bring to their game!,Grand Theft Auto V,1,

GTAV on pc is much crazier than on console so if your going to play on pc dont invest to much time into your character because youll probably have to restart because you were caught ( cheating ),Grand Theft Auto V,1,

Not the story mode cause I didn't feel like playing the story mode and... Let's just say I'm glad the internet exists.In any case its really fun. Now I shouldn't say to much since I have put some money into the game cause the online mode is admittedly pretty without friends or friendly players (good luck). But with the great white shark card its pretty easy to earn money once you put like 15 dollars into the game you can buy a company and do some deliveries. If you do have friends you can do some missions to get you started! Honestly its heavily pay 2 play. But I like to call it pay 2 have fun.Once you got some money maybe a company and a house/apartment you're set for screwing around pretty much. But time is money and if you aren't a heavy pay2play its gonna cost you A LOT of time! In fact I think you could spend 100 hours doing the hardest mission and completing them but still dont have enough money to start screwing around.TL DR Online is the real reason to play (unless you like being alone..) and while it can be pay 2 play it is fun with friends. I would recommend to those who is ready to play this game for hours. Not a unhealthy amount of time but time is needed for this game if you're not pay 2 play.Here's how I rate the major parts of the game.Graphics 10/10 (The graphics are too good that even with a GTX 1070 I cant go to the highest without lag T)Controls 8/10 (Sometimes I am annoyed at the different interact keys and how some things wont work some times)Story 3/10 (Didn't actually play it but from what I have heard it wasnt all that great to begin with)Player base activity 9/10 (if you try hard enough you can find a empty session)Personal enjoyment 8/10 (Good graphics wonky controls crap story and a hacking player base but a active one none the less),Grand Theft Auto V,1,

Probably the reason being a majority of the game is spent driving and doing so with a keyboard is a horrible chore. That and there are tons of shops around the city only a minute fraction can you go in and rob which is bothersome since finding these rob able locations is tedious as they are among all the other ""24hr open"" shops which aren't robbable. Then there were various specific annoyances. Like in failing to land a plane I have to spend another 3 minutes flying to the same landing area in the mission only to see the plane blow up on what appeared to be an invisible wall as I was landing. And just as I was putting the armored police truck in the garage a mission starts and the truck vanishes. And with all the senseless killing you'd think Frank would just kill the mexican cartel guy and perhaps his whiny family",Grand Theft Auto V,1,

It's a combination of an excellent driving game FPS RPG and strategy game all in one and it does each of these genres so well. The open world aspect and the realism is awesome. All the attention to detail is much appreciated. I believe it was 6 years in the making since GTA IV was released and I'm glad Rockstar gave it the time it deserved to perfect as much as possible. Total landmark in gaming history much like Battlefield 1942 was (for me at least) many years before. This is a must have but I'm sure anyone who plays computer games and likes any of the genres I mentioned has already got it anyway. Masterpiece!,Grand Theft Auto V,1,

A problem occurs when GTAV detects my VRAM i.e. only 768Mb of the APU can be detected while 2Gb of the discrete graphics disappears. I have tried 5 different versions of AMD drivers but the problem is always there. Activating CrossFire just doubles needed VRAM &amp available VRAM simultaneously.However this game's optimization is good so that with the problem above it can still reach 18FPS on average.

2330,"2018-08-01",0,0,246,0,0,I was put off of buying GTA 5 by the setting in San Andreas.Southern California. Big cities and deserts. The two kinds of places I can stand the least.I was put off of buying GTA 5 by the entirely unlikeable protagonists. A gangbanger and a hillbilly no one I could even remotely relate to. The third one well let's call him good enough. But then again the game doesn't allow you to play as one out of the three characters as much as it forces you to.I went to create my own character then but sure enough the game won't let me play her offline outside of director mode. I'd put it like this The game bethesda izes the GTA series in all the wrong ways. It keeps bothering me with its goddamn story and narrative that I could not care any less about.Well I knew that all before. I've bought it now at a discount to see if I manage to ignore the setting and the idiots you play somehow. It doesn't work. You keep getting into your OWN car and there's always that stupid rap crap on the radio even though I've switched the thing off some twenty times before. Driving and especially collision physics are a huge step backward from GTA 4 as well. Outside of missions etc. the game can be quite fun it's wonderful to look at especially at down and during rain and thunderstorms. But that doesn't make up for all that I've stated above. After GTA 4 I thought I had been done with the series I guess now I really am.,Grand Theft Auto V,1,

2337,"2017-09-07",0,0,168,0,1,"It's a toxic game. Lol BUT! it is the first game of its' kind where being toxic can be fun. This isn't League of Legends. There isn't a moderating bot that's watching your mouth and banning people for ""not giving them a good time"". Rockstar and ESRB make it clear ""not rated based on online play"". Which means GTA V Online is the wild west. If you get angry at someone spawn in a tank or a Hydra and gun them down. No ""Report"" buttons or anything like that. Join a lobby call someone a ing on all chat tilt them and then make people bond together over the fact that you were brutually bullying someone. Lmfao. I like seeing people come together to hate me on this game. Just yesterday I made 5 or 6 random people all come together to kill me 20+ times and they formed a group. I'm pretty sure they all added each other as friends just to hate me. Awwwie. How cute. I love it when a community comes together....But there are some flaws.Super Pay to win. Unless you were part of that wave before Take Two interactive came into the picture and became the Anti Hack police then the game is not worth investing in at all.Find a modder get $1 000 000 000 in online cash if you can and live out your days on this game holding it all in your wallet and not in your bank account so the dev team doesn't perma ban you. I doubt there are any modders left though keeping up on GTA V's news Take Two interactive shut down a modding site and issued a ""cease and desist"" order. Super fagboy gayness. Greedy money mongrils this dev team. Like $800 000 000 in REAL money isn't enough. If you are too shy in the GTA world to ask around like that then take a look at what the new DLC looks like by watching that Drill Seargant Guy on facebook who can do Family Guy and Kendrick Lamar impersonations or VanossGaming. It's a decent game to play. Just don't let your life become playing it every day taking life lessons from it and dropping off the face of the planet over how much ya care over your rank and GTA wallet. GTA V is the perfect conduit to becoming a PC Xbox or Playstation Slave.",Grand Theft Auto V,1,

It very much feels like its become a pay to win almost now Heists and the online side of it can be fun with a group of friends but outside of that the online frequently has hackers/modders in public games and those who have already got everything whether it be from grinding since the game came out or just bought in game money from irl money have all the cars planes weapons (with upgrades etc.) that unless you're playing in passive mode as a new player to online then you'll likely find someone persistantly spawn camping with a sniper or raining down missiles from above. Overall other than having a fun time in a private lobby with friends and playing a couple missions heists and everything else seems like your essentialy grinding constantly to have bragging rights over ""having the newest car"" which if thats your sort of thing then awesome DThe singleplayer is certainly more relaxed and enjoyable with an overall good story (yet to complete on pc but have played through on console in the past!). 6/10 (mostly because it feels like its started to lose quality to its online with the last couple updates/dlc's)",Grand Theft Auto V,1,

2435,"2016-07-29",0,0,355,0,1,GTA V is a really fun game with or without friends. The driving machanics are really fun but i fighting i didn't really understand at first. The map is also huge qith side missions driving contests Clubs ) and places to custimize your car. The idea i didn't get is the fact that you can't store high end cars that you may find acroos GTA's vast world in Online. Online is basically the same as the story mode just with your own character and you can play with your friend or other random people. Theor are also heists in the game which you can play with ypur friends or not. PLaying all the heists with the same people give loads of money in the end. Overall this game is really good as i've haven't run into issues asides the long load times.NOTE THIS IS MY FIRST GTA GAME SO MY OPINIONS MIGHT NOT MAKE SENSE LIKE THE CAN'T STAORE HIGH END CARS I STATED ),Grand Theft Auto V,1,

2500,"2019-02-14",0,0,21,0,0,"Full disclosure I'm old. I really enjoyed GTA II but wasn't a fan of the gratuitous violence in the series as I got older. A friend of mine convinced me to pick up GTA V he didn't have any other friends that played it was on sale and to be fair there's a lot of entertaining content available.It's for this reason that I feel genuinely bad for all of the developers and designers that put hard work into this game. The effort really shows and it has a lot of redeeming qualities. Somewhere along the way (I'm assuming pretty early on) this game became about one thing making money at the expense of everything else.A key business metric for GTA V surfaces very very quickly maximize the number of players in public sessions. It's unwieldy and not very intuitive to setup and maintain your own private session and the moment something goes wrong you're kicked back into a public session. While that might seem reasonable ""goes wrong"" has a very loose definition in this case. Most of the missions require more people than I care to play with and if someone dies or leaves at the last second I'm forced to start over. And over. And over.Even though I purchased content I'm not allowed to run certain missions in a private session. You already took my money don't make me play with the motley crowd please.This brings me to my next point. While playing with a friend and driving around in one of the neat cars I purchased my teammate steps out of the vehicle and immediately dies to someone that isn't even in the same hemisphere as us. I assumed he was being dramatic when he said that there was a hacker/modder in our session but the death toll kept climbing as the seconds ticked by. People began to chat about a modder in the session then suddenly for no reason I started to receive money while standing in place.I was astounded. Cheating is *so* prevalent in this game that it was immediately recognized by everyone in the session. Something similar happened three more times in the same night.Despite the obvious quality of this game it's very clearly being run by people that don't give a flying f*** about the experience of the players. The business model seems to be sell as much DLC as possible don't let people play the content that they payed for in private sessions do your best to force people online and then spend *zero* effort to make the game secure from people that get their kicks from ruining the enjoyment of others.Again I'm old so I don't experience disillusionment very much these days but I was sorely disappointed to see one of the most enduring and recognizable franchises in the industry brought to its knees by greed and the juvenile whims of 12 year olds.What the hell Rockstar? What the hell.",Grand Theft Auto V,1,
2501,"2019-02-14",0,0,327,0,1,I would totally recommend this game for people who are 13 and over story mode not too much but online is good you can play with your friends and just do missions to level up! No swearing or other bad or inappropriate types of things! 10/10,Grand Theft Auto V,1,

2508,"2019-02-06",0,0,363,0,1,Overall It's an amazing game wouldn't recommend to the younger audience but it is a really good game and has aged as good as it could have in the time it has been out. But that was my review on the story mode. The online mode is way to broken. To many modders and other people who just want to screw with you in any way that they can but the online mode can be fun as well. If you get yourself into a public lobby with only yourself in it you can earn money pretty fast and easy even if someone else joins that person may or may not want to screw with you but it would probably still be fun due to the fact that you wont be alone in the server and you'll have someone to compete with to get better at the game and have a better understanding of how the game works. So in conclusion the game is a good game and I would recommend to people who enjoy a good story line and a competitive online mode if you do start hating the game just get into a public lobby by yourself look it up on Youtube if you don't know how to do it.,Grand Theft Auto V,1,
2509,"2019-02-06",0,0,0,0,0,"There's a reason this game is selling so cheap. It used to be amazing until Rockstar got greedy and started manipulating the game in order to extract more money from it. All of the recent upgrades are nothing more than a money grab from the company rather than a legitimate effort to make the game better. They claim they turned off porting accounts to combat ""hacked consoles"" but in reality it's their greed that motivated this. It's simply easier and cheaper to punish everyone rather than to spend the money to patch the exploits and to punish the people breaking the rules. It's super convenient that making a player start over also makes them money if they don't want to grind through and buy a shark card eh? Typical arrogant ""if we our customer we win"" thinking. The entire GTA series had it's day but those days are long over. It's just tired and boring now. They should probably drop the ""open world"" bit too. It's just a big map. Open world implies that it's much larger and it takes no time at all to fly across this tiny island in a jet. Typical marketing speak from people who likely aren't even interested in games. With the real VR open worlds out there where you can do more than just consume content and shoot at people their description falls flat. Save your $14.99. With what those idiots are doing to this game every update it probably won't even be worth downloading when it eventually becomes free.",Grand Theft Auto V,1,

Trees and BUSHES are appearently more undestructible than a truck insurgent fences2. Why wont they update story mode with new vehicles? I mean if you want to try them out you have to spend IRL money on Online where you wont get much money but in GTA Story Mode you can afford whatever you want and there you can atleast try them out if they update it you have the money to try the vehicles out such as the Insurgent Pickup Select Michael and go meet Trevor go get an Insurgent Trevor as gunner and michael as driver and mayhem in Los Santos.3. The only way to get a decent amount of money is to play 24/7 or buy sharkcards that are overpriced AF but i still buy them to not get blowed upp by Oppressors everywhere.Oppressor MK 2 i mean the first one was OP enough but they decided to add another one.4. Rockstar game services unavailable i have checked my internet and it has a very good connection but it still says this sometimes when im going into a race or mission.5. Npcs they drive STRAIGHT into you if they get the chance i drive straight they turn left towards me so i crash in them and its 12.000 $ from the vehicle cargo.6. The Cops If THEY drive into YOU you get the cops after you stand still infront of them they're after you call lester to lose them 1 minute later they're after you for nothing. They are after you for stealing 1 CAR i mean its logical but its GTA nothing in GTA is logical (Flying cars flying bikes and undestructible bushes)7. Spawn locations i was killed by aimbot NPCs and i respawned on an island... I couldnt call Merrywheater for pickups or anything like that so i was forced to swim for 20 mins.8.

But i STILL play it i think this game deserves new developers R* wont care about fixing this ""Rockstar game services are currently down try again later"" problem they just wait for the sharkcard money to roll in when they still have millions that are buying the game and they wont change the prices on sharkcards YES im pretty mad at this game at this point no Call me salty kid all you want but this game is just more t than good like 60% of the time.",Grand Theft Auto V,1,

It has one of the best stories I've played in an open world game. The Multiplayer is... okay.GTA Online can be pretty fun at times if you have money. Unfortunately the game is pretty grindy when it comes to money even with maxed out stuff it can take a good amount of time to build up a good amount. Hackers are also a legitimate issue Rockstar doesn't seem to to a terribly good job at keeping them out of play.,Grand Theft Auto V,1,
2523,"2019-01-18",0,0,190,0,1,"The review is simple games are absolutely good games no doubt but a good game is a failure of bad operations.I would like to talk about the plug in problem some people say this problem is to blame those who open right they are the source.Everything has a source just like everything has both good and bad sides the world tells us that it is foolish to go to the source.We try to compare the people who are hanging out to the bad guys and in this world or in a society it's impossible to be short of bad guys because there's always a source.Let's just think is there any country in the world that can prevent bad people from being born?There is noSo what is everybody doing yeah trying to figure out how to deal with to limit to pass the constitution to pass the criminal law all kinds of things that can have an inhibitory effect and actually do something about itBut I feel like Rockstar didn't do it maybe they didn't have the ability to do it or they like a lot of players put the onus on the sourceBut oneself is through ""random"" seal the decision such as number to stop the plug in phenomenon time will tell you this does not useI would say that no matter what award GTA V wins how much money it makes how big an achievement it is in the history of gamingBut one way to go down to death then this is a failure of the game这个评论很简单 游戏绝对是好游戏 毋庸置疑的 可是 一款好游戏却败在了不好的运营之下 我要说的就是外挂问题 有人说 这个问题该去怪那些开挂的人 对的 他们是源头 任何事情都有源头 就像任何东西都有好与坏两方面 这个世界告诉我们追究源头是愚蠢的做法 我们尝试把那些开挂的人比作坏人 在这个世界 或一个社会都不可能缺少坏人 因为总会有源头 我们不妨想想 这个世界上有任何一个国家可以让坏人无法产生吗 没有那大家都在做什么 没错 都在想办法应对 限制 通过宪法 刑法各种可以产生抑制效果的东西 并付出实际行动但我感觉Rockstar并没有做到 也许他们没有能力做到 或者他们和很多玩家一样 把责任全抛给了源头而自己则是通过 随机 封号这样的决策来制止外挂现象 时间会告诉你 这并没有用我想说 无论GTA V获得什么奖项 赚了多少钱 成为游戏历史上多大的成就也好但一条路走下去走到死 那么这就是一个失败的游戏",Grand Theft Auto V,1,

They noticed that they could milk money out of GTA V completely ignoring the community making it harder for them to gain money and ignoring the things the COMMUNITY wants. Developers have been known to do this but not to the extent of rockstar. They don't do jack about the modders. They despite belief do ban but the shear amount of them is too much. We are screaming at them to get dedicated servers but they choose to ignore us. Thus FiveM was born the roleplaying delight. If you have GTA but your sick of the hackers modders toxic community etc. Go to FiveM. Now GTAO has sparked many good moments for me. But rockstar keeps taking 1 step forward and 2 steps back. If you like previous GTA games but you're on the edge of buying it. Don't. This is not the same game as the previous in the series. It is too expensive for what you get for an aged game.,Grand Theft Auto V,1,

I would appreciate Rockstar a lot more if they ve done something about singleplayer because how good the story is. Sure the main focus is between the bond of three would be heroes and does not focus on side characters sucks but there are memorable missions in the game that I won t forget.I mainly play Online now because I m currently redoing the entirety of singleplayer to do everything correctly and how Rockstar had the intentions of how it should be played but Rockstar needs two separate teams that focuses on Online and story mode rather than focusing on Online only. I would greatly appreciate that but for now I ll keep this review as a negative until they make changes to singleplayer.,Grand Theft Auto V,1,

2550,"2018-08-20",0,0,107,0,1,After few days playing this game I found out that this is one of the most interesting GTA games ever. In my perspective there are pros and cons.StoryWell... I can't describe it but a combo of real life situations such as family problems and a bank heist setup is just awesome. Nothing to say.VehiclesA lot of new vehicles have been introduced in this game and unlike previous one (GTA IV) this has over more than 400 vehicles to be offered either offline or online. It also brings back the airplanes functionality as in San Andreas.To bring back the vehicles from the previous one (GTA IV) you have to use mods (see Modding Capability).CameraFirst Person Perspective (FPP) was not my preferrence at start but since there's an achievement for it I did it for more than a day play time. The FPP camera is just awesome like... this is like when I play some of the First Person Shooter (FPS) games. Even the fighter jets and combat helicopters in FPP also featuring simple version of Joint Helmet Mounted Cueing System (JHMCS) with airspeed and altitude indicator just like in flight simulator games.Online FeaturePeople talk about cheaters and yes there are too many. I've encountered one along my way and I chose not to interfere just to be on a safe side. And if I lose the RGSC account because of cheating (even though it wasn't me) not only I lose access to multiplayer (GTA Online) but also the singleplayer so that my modding freedom is at risk (see Modding Capability).Modding CapabilityMyself's a long time modder before I have this game and I also made several mods. Come to think of it this game has a ton of stability that makes this game safe for modding of any kind like adding new vehicles people... you name it. I tried more than 100+ different mods and they work without any negative drawbacks. However mods and going online didn't go too well so it's meant only for singleplayer mode.My current PC specification when applied with a lot of mods can cause FPS drop to maybe 15 or 10 depending on the complexity and type of the mod.AnimationBasic animations are much more enhanced than previous GTA game but there's a con on the weapons animation especially the shotgun animation. I found the Pump Shotgun and Sawn off Shotgun animations are quite weird because every time you reload you just put in a shotgun shell and it while in a real life you put in how much it can load into a barrel before you can use it. Previous one was about 2 shells when you reload. I found it really unrealistic if being compared with FPS games such as Call of Duty but hey this is a video game. What can you expect?OtherI'm taking into an account that the environment of the game was good. Place of setting was more or less same to the real Los Angeles city although I never visited that city in real life. Vehicle physics was quite good although from some video titles on YouTube previous one was better than this despite negative drawbacks on that. The game's an open world and you can do anything about it. In singleplayer mode (after finishing all story missions) I prefer to get chased by 50 police officers and shoot them and to do that I prefer not to kill too many civilians. Other than that is loitering buying property meeting strangers or met some random guy in GTA Online. Most of them I met preferred to pick a fight if in freeroam mode no matter who is friend or foe.In conclusion this game is a symbol of good gesture for all GTA lovers like me although like I said there are pros and cons. With the announcement of GTA VI come near I hope it can be improved better than this one.,Grand Theft Auto V,1,

What we have now is a great single player open world game attached to one of the best sandboxes that exists today where you can mess around with friends! Constantly getting free updates that add new ways to play and earn money although some grinding will be required for the more expensive items.How to deal with hackers Find a new lobbySeriously though this game has an amazing single player campaign and buying it just for that is well worth it. I think a lot of people let their entire review live and die on GTA Online. While it has bugs hackers and can require lots of grinding if you don't pay for the GTA$ it is not without it's many upsides.Even after 3 years many of the major gamebreaking bugs that pop up once in a blue moon are quickly squashed by Rockstar. They have diverted work from GTA VI for this game and continue to pump out DLC and quality of life updates that give people new races weapons and vehicles. Hackers are a big problem but if you suspect someone to be hacking report them and move on. No point in waiting around for them to drap cash on you getting you banned. And as for the of the game if you are not wanting to play CEO or MC missions then go passive mode or have fun fighting them. Play that part of the game. And if not then find a new lobby. Plain and simple. Yes it can be a pain but it's better than giving them the satisfaction and you the anger.This game sure as hell isnt perfect but people become so entitled that they don't see that there are plenty of ways to enjoy the game they just choose not to.Stay safe ),Grand Theft Auto V,1,

2576,"2019-02-12",0,0,87,0,0,"Voice acting is superb. Animations are very good. Online and let's be honest you really want to play this online You struggle to make any money at all when you're starting so you either buy shark cards with real money to get the literally millions of dollars you need to actually set up businesses to make money or...you never ever make enough money to actually start making money. At $20 cash per million you can expect to pay hundreds to set up businesses. Now once you actually have millions of dollars you can be like all the cool kids and buy a rocket firing flying car which allows you to breeze through missions. Don't worry though if you manage to get enough money to start your own cash making business which literally takes HOURS to make any product for you to sell be it guns drugs whatever...then the fun really begins because now you need to be on a public server to actually drive the goods to market. At which point those kids with rocket firing flying cars get bonuses for killing you and destroying your goods. So much fun can't possibly fit into one game.Oh yeah and lets not forget the ""loading"" screen which at the best of times takes several minutes every time you start a mission end a mission start a match end a match. I put in 70 hours online and probably spend at least 10 hours looking at loading screens and apparently that's typical. Story mode offline Sure this one is fantastic. But your solo play doesn't interest Rockstar because you aren't buying shark cards with cash and that's really where the expected to make their money. The game itself is fantastic with a massive open world you can explore dozens of vehicles to drive and fly thousands of npc's to punch in the face. Hundreds of hours of fun. It could be thousands of hours of fun if they stopped catering to that 1% of gamers who got picked on as kids and now live to lord their in game superiority over those little people by shooting every other player with rockets from their flying cars. I would be lying if I saw anyone over level 300 who wasn't simply killing other players for fun because that's the only kind of person who sticks with this game online.",Grand Theft Auto V,1,

I am not recommending you purchase this game I am demanding it.The graphics are Prison Architect style if you haven't gathered from the trailer which actually go really well with this style of sim/surv.The gameplay is amazing/complex/difficult/rewarding. You can spend HOURS (and I've spent way more than my feeble number lists here) just trying to make sure your food chain and good shelter isn't interrupted. If you buy ONE game this year buy this.

2605,"2017-01-18",239,706,120,1,1,I felt like I had to share my experiences with RimWorld so far ... So I had just established my young but promising new colony Ashton (a quite ironical name in the end ...). The basic needs were all covered everyone had a nice place to sleep decent clothing enough to eat and time to relax. The people of Ashton were prosperous. They lived in harmony with nature and each other. Their wide fields provided them with plenty of food and they sold the surplus to the passing by caravans.Now and then a few warriors of a near tribe the Pig Face Men attacked the settlement but the people of Ashton were safe relying on the strength of their automated defence systems. And so the colony grew and I thought This is it I finally have a colony which doesn't collapse after a few hours.As if ...Remember when I told you about the harmony between the people and with nature? I meant there were no rivalries between the colonists most were friends and there even was a married couple Tali and Waltz.The harmony with nature also seems pretty coherent the people relied mostly on their crops eating only those animals which died by natural causes (e.g. old age or other animals) so the animal population in the near forests remained stable. So far so good. But taking those dead animals in meant of course someone had to leave the safe area of Ashton and wander through the wilds. Normally that wouldn't have been a problem everyone was equipped with guns and armor of the Pig Face Men so they were quite ready to take on anything coming in their way. But then came the tortoise. Waltz left Ashton to get the still fresh corpse of a hilla which had been killed by some other animal. So Waltz has just grabbed it when a tortoise nearby turned mad. I thought ok those aren't that fast Waltz will be able to safely carry the hilla inside and the turrets will take care of the tortoise. Nope! I'm not quite sure what exactly happened maybe this animal was on speed or something like thak. Anyway when it saw Waltz it charged at him at a horrifying pace. Waltz had just lifted his weapon when this damn creature reached and hurt him badly. However its hard shell was no match for Waltz' gun. And so he came back home injured but happy that now there was even more meat than expected. But the wraith of the tortoise was unforgiving. The bite wounds in his upper body infected themselves. The medical treatment didn't work and he got weaker and weaker. If the infection at least would've been in one of his limbs that might had saved him but you can't just amputate someones chest.At last he couldn't fight any longer the infection overwhelmed him. Tali his wife carved his story in the sides of his sarcophagus. The burial ceremony was heartbreaking. Everyone had come Tali his sister Julia his friends Vas Jones Stephan Boyd and Leia Vas' tame wolf Nevile and Bacon 1 and Bacon 2. In the light of the evening sun they all waved a last goodbye to their fallen husband brother and friend before the people of Ashton went to bed. With Waltz dead or not they had to cary on.But apparently it was all too much for Tali not very surprising if you think about it. There was only this one little problem She was a pyromaniac. When the rest of the colony slept she left her big and empty bed. Driven crazy by grief she did the only thing able to ease her pain. She set the forest on fire. Finally exhausted almost to unconciousness she fell back into her bed again.While she slept the others waken by the crackling fire desperately tried to put out the flames which already started to spread over to the buildings. But they simply weren't enough they could either try to save the buildings or the forest not both. Of course they tended to the buildings to the food storage to be exact. However it gave the fire the chance to spread through the forest completely sorrounding the settlement.In the end it was all too much.Tali died in her own fire that she refused to extinguish Jones and Boyd followed when they collapsed in the infernal heat. And then when no hope was left the gods the ancestors the Flying Spaghetti Monster or whatever thi people of Ashton believed in heard their cries. Rain started falling down putting out the fire. But it was too late. More than three quarters of the colony had been taken by the flames. Vas Stephan and Leia were unconcious. Julia was the only one still able to stand. She did what she could but with all the medicine burned she had no chance. Leia died first Vas second. This caused his wolf Nevile who had been laying loyal by his side to turn mad like the damn tortoise and he ripped the still unconcious Stehpan into pieces before he went on attacking a herd of muffalos (some kind of marshmellow like buffalos) which was his end.Traumatised Julia who managed to flee when Stephan was killed wandered through the burnt ruins of Ashton. Blackened stone walls and pieces of charcoal everywhere. All the food they stored for the winter was gone the fields empty. With no medicine left and her own wounds hurting worse and worse Julia found a last smokeleaf joint in one of the destroyed buildings. She leant against her brother's sarcophagus and lit it. So she didn't feel anything when the Pig Face Men attacked. With the solar panels a loss to the flames the turrets didn't react when Ashton's last inhabitant finally exhaled her last breath.12 / 10 Creates more immersive storys than many RPGs looking forward to my next colony (and possibly its desastrous destruction ...).Thanks for reading if you made it this far ),RimWorld,1,
2606,"2017-11-22",0,0,89,1,1,This game reaches level of complexity I have never seen in a videogame. Don't be fooled by the graphical style this game is a monster under the hood. 10/10,RimWorld,1,

2608,"2017-06-03",395,2070,560,1,1,If you're thinking of buying this game stop hesitating and purchase it immediately.I started an isolated research facility on a frozen wasteland as a 74 year old sociopathic scientist called Geckulon Decktar I researched robotics to begin with and constructed some automatons to handle the menial tasks like cleaning cooking and hauling etc leaving me free to conduct my research. All was well until a band of vagrants laid siege to my settlement. I barely survived and resolved to increase my security installing several auto turrets around my perimeter. This would keep the ruffians at bay for a time but I needed a longer term solution so I turned my focus to bionic enhancements. I wanted to turn the human form into the ultimate living weapon. When a faction of slavers passed through my frozen wasteland I did not hesitate to inspect their wares. I wanted a slave but not just any slave he should be foreboding brutal savage. And there I found him His name was Skint Mcgruff. He was a feared crime lord when they captured him infamous for killing and then devouring the people who wronged him. I paid the slavers their due and took Skint in. I fed him (alas not human meat but nutrient paste made from potatoes poor fare but such is life in the frozen wastes) and I clothed him. By now I was confident in my ability to improve upon the human form and so I presented the idea to him the very next day. He was keen particularly about the notion of having retractable claws and so the work began. My medical droid handled most of the surgery but I crafted the bionic components myself. It was a long and gruelling process but eventually he was complete. More machine now than man I felt it necessary to rename him... to symbolise his departure from prosaic humanity to something more and thus I named him C.A.N.N.I.B.A.L (Cybernetic Armoured Neutraliser with Neurally Integrated Bionic Attack Limbs). He is my pride and joy... bionic eyes that can see even in the dark bionic legs that allow him to sprint faster than a cheetah and retractable claws with which to tear out the throats of my foes and of course I give him leave to feast on their corpses afterward as a reward. Now I can conduct my research in peace...,RimWorld,1,

2610,"2017-06-22",0,0,49,1,1,Certainly worth.,RimWorld,1,
2611,"2018-09-18",6,513,439,1,1,I've played RimWorld for easily over 1000 hours aside from the 160+ hours on record for my account I really should have reviewed it sooner since I've played it so long but I never got around to it so this'll include my experience in the game what's good and bad and everything you'd likely need to know before getting it.To jump to my conclusion This game is fantastic if you like build a colony from the ground up it's very interactive and you'll always have something to do be it planning a new room for your base building up defenses creating a more reliable food source or even raiding enemy factions. At first it's very daunting as there is a lot to get used to but each new discovery comes with a new way to experience the game your story is always your own and it'll never be the same as before lending this game to nigh infinite replayability and that's not even considering mods which are abundant relatively easy to make yourself and very active. The developers constantly revise and improve aspects of the game improving it more and more as time passes even your own ideas may be implemented if they're good additions to the game. The community is one of the best I've seen where people joke around share their playthroughs and wacky happenings whilst generally having a good time. I recommend this game if you like strategy tackling positive/negative turn of events planning things and sandbox style survival games. If you're still on the fence for buying the game watch a 'lets play' video and see madness that can occur check out all the mods that are available and imagine the possibilities it really is a great game.Art 8/10 The art style is quite minimalistic at first it may be a turn off but the style works well with the gameplay with the attention you need to pay to so many things on screen it's good that the textures aren't complex as it'd strain your eyes whereas this style is soft on the eyes and doesn't impede the gameplay things represent what they're meant to be and it's surprisingly easy to get immersed into the game with the simplistic graphics.Story 10/10 This game is both heart breaking and hilarious there is no set story so things can go in any direction you could have a trader caravan arrive to sell items just as a raid occurs causing a massively shoot out between two major groups just outside your base after which you can mop up all their valuables and turn their corpses into meals and skin maybe for that human leather hat you've always wanted. Perhaps you start brewing beer only to have one of your pets drink some and get addicted to alcohol. Story is incredibly well done in this game and with how fun it can be I'm surprised lots of other games don't use the same style.Sound 6/10 The sound is basic like the art the sounds work for their intended purposes there's nothing spectacular to talk about nor is there anything unique the sound it has is right but it's not something the game is well known for and isn't made to contribute a lot to the game.Gameplay 8/10 There are different types of games so I'll elaborate for the style of game this is (a sci fi colony sim) I'd say the gameplay is near perfect and it can be perfected to a player's liking with mods a lot of features from popular mods are incorporated into the game over time so the base game's gameplay will get even better over time. Things are placed using the UI at the bottom of the screen and your colonists with build them if they have the resources they can get the resources from your setting up of work orders (like cutting down trees mining rocks butchering animals harvesting plants and various other ways). It's almost like you're the architect of a colony telling them what needs to be done and when it needs to be done it's quite nice as luck is a big factor but foresight allows you to somewhat control your luck and mitigate disaster there's little that's more satisfying than diverting misfortune with a well thought out plan.Mods 9/10 Mods are very good for this game some change the game entirely (like changing the space cowboy style theme to that of Lord of the Rings Medieval WW2 era and many others) whilst others change / add to the games features and tools allowing for you to adjust anything you don't like into something you do like and the modding community is quite active if there's a good idea for a mod then it's likely already made If you choose to buy it then I recommend trying the base game without mods first as whilst they add a lot to the game they also take away from the main theme playing it without mods will help you understand the fundamentals a lot quicker.Overall 9/10 The features individually would make the game an 8.2/10 but how they come together makes it a 9/10 for me since RimWorld is the best game of it's type I've looked long and hard for other games like it and Prison Architect is the only game similar but to me it doesn't have the random glory that RimWorld has. RimWorld is certainly worth 30 hell it's worth 50+ to me since I've got so much entertainment out of it other games you may play for 200 maybe 300 hours but this is one of those games which you can sink months into and games like that are worth buying.Thanks for reading my review if you did I don't often write reviews but this game is just so good that I can't help but share my opinion.,RimWorld,1,
2612,"2017-11-17",0,0,563,1,1,While it is lacking many features and plenty of content this game is hours upon hours of fun and constantly expanding stories. Playing different difficulties and scenarios allow you to play a different game every time. New and interesting workshop mods for content and stories make the game equally as enjoyable as the base game. Over all 9/10 being because it's still lacking many features but it is still a fantastic game all around.,RimWorld,1,

2614,"2016-11-16",382,537,39,1,1,Let's say you capture a prisoner after a bloody raid on your colony. Do you want to 1. Let them go in the hopes of improving relations with the attackers? YOU CAN DO THAT.2. Heal them and have colonists talk to them about how great your colony is until they join? YOU CAN DO THAT.3. Have a colonist with a high medical skill remove their liver to transplant into an alcoholic colonist? YOU CAN DO THAT.4. Have a colonist with a low medical skill remove their organs just for practice? YOU CAN DO THAT.5. Eat them because you forgot to stock up on food for the winter? YOU CAN DO THAT.Really what else do you need in a game?,RimWorld,1,
2615,"2018-07-09",214,550,635,0,1,"I've been fiddling around with challenging game modes rather than the stock three. So I began a game with absolutely nothing other than the starting colonist no food no weapon no silver. I've then opted then to go for a mountainous region cause it's easier to defend from attackers.This is where things get interesting normally what happens now is you get to choose your colonist. I thought ""Right i want a good miner someone who can farm relatively well and I guess a good fighter to start off with"". Off I go cycling through the colonists where I stumble upon Patrice. Patrice was at everything I'm talking zero's one's and two's across the board with the exception of Art which was seven and Social which was bloody eighteen.I thought to myself how the hell does she have such a high social skill so I read her backstory. Now Patrice was just twenty years old very young but she had done so much. Patrice wanted to sing for everybody luckily for her Dad was the CEO of an interplanetary corporation and set her up as a Childhood Idol. Patrice sang her poor heart out for everybody and made her parents proud. Until her mum died dad was beside himself lost in his thoughts Patrice at this stage was developing into a woman and 'offered' herself to dad as a replacement for mum which he accepted....The shenanighans went on until the corporation executives discovered Patrice and dad's secret and gave dad an ultimatum ""Give us your daughter or we go public with what's been happening between you two ruining both your lives in the process"". Dad agreed and sent poor Patrice away.The executives kept Patrice in an orbital station on the galactic fringes far away from daddy where they used Patrice for a new kind of job if you know what I mean say hello to Patrice's adult background Pornographic Idol. Yes you read that correctly Patrice was now sold into sexual slavery. But it wasn't all that bad she wasn't a typical ' ' as it where more like a Companion from Firefly where she selected her clients. She became very popular amongst the nobility of the region. Attended balls and had a cult following much like her childhood.I thought to myself ""Holy crap Batman WTF did I just read?"". This story was absolutely nuts I had to try to help Patrice live a better life. Off we went to Patrice's new home. I'm assuming at this stage she's been rescued by some unknown benefactor. Anyway Patric lands right in the centre of a small clearing surrounded by mountain with only one opening and fertile land within that area too. ""Score!!"" I thought as I got her to work setting up a shelter bed and torch. Bloody hell wasn't this a task for her? It took two days to complete this menial task but together we persevered. Eventually she completed this task cutting down a dozen trees in the process and skilling up two levels in construction.Then the feral rabbit came knocking ""Crap"" I had to get her to safety fortunately this rabbit tired itself rather quickly and left Patrice alone after it slept. I got Patrice to fashion herself a club to use and just in the nick of time well I say nick of time but it took her a whole day to get this done too. At this stage she hasn't even gotten to setting up a farm luckily there are heaps of wild berries around.A visitor arrives and Patrice says hi but she has no goods to sell so they leave in a hurry as they are leaving sirens roar as we're under attack. The attacker has a shiv loves to fight and has eight skill. ""We're finished"" I think as the attacker runs down towards the village but attacks the visitor the visitor manages to put a solid slug into the attacker but is killed in the process. The attacker is wounded but proceeds to move towards Patrice I order Patrice to stay behind the door ready with her club. The attacker busts the door down and charges in but after suffering from blood loss Patrice is able to knock him out with a single swing from her club.Patrice locks him up in her room after fixing the door and manages to stop the bleeding thanks to some bandages the visitor had. Then I got to see Patrice do what she did best talk to people. You see what normally happens is these attackers are hard as nails to recruit to your village with some taking days and even seasons before joining your community Patrice didn't even need food to entice him as soon as she walked into the room he instantly switched sides and became Patrice's . Patrice was a God amongst men as she began her new dynasty Patrice settled into her new roles as town artist and socialite while minion one got to work erecting a wall finishing some farmland and contructing a kitchen and dining room for Patrice to enjoy all in a day's work as it were.Patrice gathered up the supplies the visitor 'donated' equiping herself with a rifle in the process and set to work skilling up. It was like a switch was flicked now she had a minion to dominate she finished everything with precision and haste. She developed a taste in gardening as the minion went to work digging out the tunnels constructing two cells for conversation duties and completing a new throne room and Queen's chambers for Patrice.This is where the story of Patrice ends..... for now... I'm actually looking forward to resuming the tale of Patrice.Rimworld can be full of trash normally I would look purely at the stats of a character to pick them for me but Patrice has changed my attitude here now I look at the stories these colonists have as the main driving factor in selecting them.Edit Just getting my point for a review listing Rimworld for GOTYFYI I have the Patrice save file played a touch she's still alive.",RimWorld,1,

2618,"2017-06-27",27,496,54,1,1,"You're reading the reviews thinking ""Damn some of these people have like 300+ hours on this they must really like it."" Then you're looking at the price thinking ""That much?"" Definitely worth it in my opinion. And I've only played for 20 hours (and have gotten not too much done because there is so much to do). It's the best base building survival I've played yet. You get attached enough to some of your colonists that you become sad if anything happens to them. You can build your colony however you want to. Think of it like a top down minecraft. You're not limited on how you want to build your base at all except you can't build multi leveled buildings. (Two story).Every colonist has their own personality. IE My hunter Lumine is probably one of my most useful colonists. She can snipe targets from long distances with perfect headshots. However Lumine is staggeringly ugly and has an annoying voice. So my colonists don't really like her much. My surgeon Toni has been through so much. She has gotten her leg and arm ripped off so I've operated on her and given her a metal arm and leg. She is literally Edward Elric except instead of fighting Scar she is healing Scars. Different Survival Elements. You need to keep your colonists cool when it's hot and warm when it's cold. You can do this in different ways such as crafting them the right clothing and having heaters/coolers. Your colonists need to eat. You can have them eat raw humans and animals like savages or you can have them butcher animals and cook different meals so that they can stay healthy. You need to build a freezer so that your food won't deteriorate. You need a medical room for the best effective chances of successful operations and treatment. You'll need to build wind turbines and solar generators so you can give power to the things in your base that require it. You need to build a research bench and research new... well basically everything. So the game doesn't just give you everything that's available. You have to work for it. In the regular mode of the base game you start off with 3 colonists. And you stick with them for a while and think ""When am I going to get more? This is kind of slow since I only have 3 people."" Next thing you know you have like 10 people who are all doing their own jobs. Be it people you recruited or people who fell from cargo pods from space.And I've only been talking about your base. This game has an entirely randomly generated world that your colony is in. Which means trade caravans will visit you different tribes will visit you. You can visit them by forming caravans of your own. You can even raid other bases. You can eventually build comms equipment to contact different trading ships that are in orbit or the different outposts nearby. And you will get raided by a lot of different outposts as well which means you will have to set up defences. You can take prisoners and either recruit them release them eat them or harvest them for their organs. Yep. Don't want those perfectly good kidneys to go to waste now do we? If you don't want to take prisoners you can have your colonist slit the injured guys throat. It's cold man. They just walk right up to the injured fella and either shoot them until they die or brutally stab them to death.Now one important thing that this game offers which any good game offers Mods.To me mods fill the important content that the developers have not added yet. More turrets more organized menus more furniture more everything. Even the option to show visitors hospitality so that you can better establish friendship or even recruit them to your colony! I can't imagine playing the game without some of the mods that I have installed. Not that the vanilla game is bad it's just that some of the mods are so useful and necessary that I wouldn't want to play without them. And none of the mods I have are cheats either. You need to use your valuable recourses in order to craft everything including objects from mods. So definitely check the workshop out once you get the game. The only negative that I have so far isn't very much a negative of the game but just me being a little whiner.Sometimes some of the random events are very highly not in your favor and completely unfair. Which will result in you reloading an autosave or main save just to prevent the event from happening. When you reload a save that event that played out gets replaced with a different random event. So you're getting raided by a bunch of people while half your colonists have severe illnesses? No worries! Just reload a save! It's saved my colony a bunch of times. Sometimes I've let some of my colonists die and I've continued the game but most of the time I just reload an autosave to prevent their deaths. It's an easy way to cheat the system. Overall it's a great game. There is a reason you're seeing people with hundreds of hours on it. Every single player's game is different. Different bases different colonists. So many outcomes. It's why you see so many people posting their stories on their reviews. It's a game that I didn't even know I wanted until I played it. Amazing community. Especially the modding community. It's making the game so much more than it already is. 10/10 would have one of my rookie hunters shoot at a hare 40 times point blank only to miss give up and go stargaze. Oh and don't let your colonists go on a mental breakdown. ESPECIALLY IF THEY HAVE THE PYROMANIC TRAIT. My god. Freakin Engie literally sets fire to everything she helped build. Try to arrest them or reload a save. They will burn everything slaughter your cats/dogs fight your own colonists and wreak havoc as much as the random evented angry hares that can destroy your entire colony if you're not prepared. I probably missed a lot in my review. But hey you will discover that yourself once you play it. So what are you waiting for?",RimWorld,1,

2621,"2017-11-06",529,505,472,0,1,"Heavily 1 game! And the following play through should make you either highly appalled or very interested Started off with a monkey as a pet. Named her ""Butters"" but later on my pet monkey took a liking to another guy named Bones. It made me a tiny bit sad. Built a nice settlement made the entire surroundings and buildings out of the easiest findable supply around wood. Ended up with 5 villagers after having successfully defended our 'village' a couple of times and converted 2 of the pirate prisoners to join our cause. They eventually did.(I'm skipping the story about the micromanagement and supply hoarding business you'll learn about this on the spot yourself.) I thought I had things going smoothly. Perhaps a bit too flawless. Characters got along well and two of them actually married eachother early on. It was a joyful moment for Bones and Greta. Bones had a dislike for clothes so he was always running around naked which was not appreciated by some. But apparently he had a passion for farming and was well endowed. Greta took the earliest opportunity and showed him some loving. Greta was listed as a lazy and weapon hating person but not too lazy to chase down some 'bone'. Good for her. My self created character named Adante was a tireless fat miner and the other two people named Dorothy and Hunter were your average run of the mill converted prisoners from earlier battles. Dorothy could cook up some decent meals and Hunter well as the name implies he was hunting down the animals for the food to make nice meals mixed up with the harvested crops from our farms. Luxurious and plentiful meals of variety. Even salt was added for flavour.But then an event changed the atmosphere quite rapidly A nasty cobra snuck into the settlement and had its fangs set on Butters the pet Monkey and I did not notice as I was looking to mine some shizzle. They battled eachother like no tomorrow and the fight lasted quite long because by the time I had actually noticed the pet monkey had all her limbs bitten off by the snake and was crying for help while still being pounded by the Cobra. The sound of the monkey cries... it still traumatizes me to this day. Bones probably noticed long before I did but hey he loves being naked and probably didn't want to risk being bitten in dangling places so did nothing to help out. Hunter however eventually shot &amp killed the cobra before it could put a killing blow on the poor limbless cryin' monkey. Butters was then picked up by Hunters carried and put in Bones' room to keep him comfortable with some painkillers while we figure out a way to get his limbs back. There are ways in this game to do so be it four wooden pegs or made out of other technology but it takes some craftmanship to pull this off. By the time that we've managed to construct these an electric storm came down on the settlement as if it was telling us YOUR INTENTIONS ARE NOBLE BUT THE MONKEY MUST DIE!(Now here's a lesson I've learned Never make your ENTIRE settlement out of wood.) The storm caused fire to start and spread like wildfire. All villagers were alerted and commanded to extinguish the fire. The fire became so intense and spread from the storages and houses straight to the farm area (and all over the entire map all animals and trees on the entire map were burned alive.) Now the house in which Butters was still 'recovering' was also hit by the fire. I sent my main character Adante to help out but the fire enclosed the area in a rapid speed. My fat miner and his slow jigglywiggly runs could not win that race by a long shot. He was a hauler not a speedy gonzalez. Butters the poor cursed monkey just shrieked and screamed her lungs out when the fire was getting closer and closer after every second. So within seconds we could hear the cries again of a pet Monkey. Not only in pain from snake bites and losing all limbs before but now also jumping by the belly up &amp down inside her once comfortable pet bed being on fire. Every villager probably had tears in the eyes from that whole ordeal once the fire started demanding the limbless body and a Monkey fighting for the last breath of her life. I made Bones since he's supposedly the new master of Butters go into the flames and try to retrieve the monkey while the plan was to let him carry the monkey into the water at a nearby lake. This turned Bones into a running naked man carrying a limbless monkey across the settlement while both being on fire. The outcome of this is probably easy to guess. They burned together into (what it seemed) a neverending sea of flames and emotion. I ordered all my other villagers to stand in the water of the lake and wait out the fire frenzy. They were all depressed and Greta simply lost it and ran into the firesea on her own accord due to severe depression.After the fire died I stopped playing and told the story to my girlfriend. Her eyes opened wide and then the question came ""What kind of f***ed up game is that?""Rimworld my dear. It's Rimworld. true story",RimWorld,1,

2624,"2018-09-17",66,450,1065,1,1,I play naked brutality randy random and merciless on permadeath. Needless to say most of my games don't last long but i love the challenge.In my last game my solo guy got attacked by a hungry bear and managed to kill him with just his knife (+1 deadfall trap) but he still collapsed from the pain. I waited anxiously to see if he would recover on his own and when he did i changed his title to the 'The Revenant'. He got a scratch scar and made himself a pair of pants from the bearskin.For me this game is like a book.When i read a book i use my imagination to draw the characters and places using the author's descriptive writing and i can 'watch' the drama and action unfold in my head.When i play this game I find myself doing the same thing. The character traits and the story teller events create a story and i can image the live action movie behind the games' pixels.I definately recommend.,RimWorld,1,

Agent Makkisen Blitz Samantha John and himself. Suddenly a blight wipes out the potato crops and he can't grow new ones fast enough to feed the colony. Makkisen goes berserk from hunger kills Keanu and eats his corpse throwing her into another rampage. Ah RimWorld.RimWorld Adventures Part 2 Comba and Jacob are the only two colonists in the middle of the desert near an oasis. They have lived there for a little over 160 days. They take no prisoners and play chess together a lot. I decide to spend a bit of metal and components on a geothermal generator outside my base's extremely thick walls. I used materials from my solar panels I destroyed to build the generator. Little did I know I used my last component on the geothermal generator. Then a wave of raiders attacks and my auto defence mows most of them down. One of the raiders has a triple shot rocket launcher. He fires it causing a chain reaction on my turrets and destroys them all. Comba and Jacob kill the last few raiders and I designate new turrets to be built. I go grab a sandwich while they do this. I get back to find that the turrets have not been built and a wave of mechanoids is heading towards my base. I don't have any more components to build turrets and a single mechanoid could probably take out both of my colonists. There are ten. I accept my fate as Comba's head is blown clean off by a mechanoid sniper and john is filled with bullets from three miniguns.Some say this game is easy and some say it is hard. I say it holds your hand a little too much. And by hold your hand i mean rip off your arm and slap the open shoulder wound with your severed arm.,RimWorld,1,

2628,"2017-10-27",15,298,757,1,1,"This game was on my wishlist for months just waiting for a sale so I could try it out. But as months went by it never once dipped in price and during a night of unfathomable boredom I decided to take the plunge forked over the $29.99 and started to play one of the most awesome games ever. Naturally I set a timer to 2 hours in case I wanted a refund but that wasn't the case as I was hooked in before the first hour ended and knew after looking over the modding community that this game is a keeper. That first time I played it I didn't stop until the sun rose and I realized it was almost 6 in the morning after playing for 8 hours straight.If you are like me and are waiting for a sale it seems like that won't happen anytime soon or at least it never seems to happen and this review is to encourage you to take the plunge and have a good time. It is absolutely worth the $29.99 you don't need to wait for a sale it's worth it and while it may not click with you immediately it is met with ""overwhelmingly positive"" reviews for a reason and it is a ton of fun. Very interesting concept too and executed in a way that is easy to learn difficult to master and incredibly addicting regardless of the outcome of your pawns.Most of my colonies die at one point or another. Most of yours will too. It is not a bad thing it is not a sad thing and it shouldn't make you mad and I don't think it will unless you are like insane about ""losing"". It's just how the story unfolds though and it's part of the game and part of the fun. Another reviewer put it perfectly saying ""Colonies are here for a good time not a long time"". However sometimes they do last and it's cool progressing everything getting more people to join and experimenting with what to do next as you make it further and further in the new world you are trying to make. Currently my longest lasting colony started out as a tribe of 5 people but has grown and thrived and may defeat the odds against them in surviving in the world as a colony to be reckoned with. Maybe someday they'll even make it off the planet if I choose to make it so.Point is this game is worth its price tag. Give it a go you may find yourself immersed in one of the coolest games with a wonderful modding community aiming to make each run a different engaging and exciting experience. Update 11/13/17 Below I tell you a tale of a distant Rimworld. They started as a group of three crashlanding in a small patch of temperate forest surrounded by the green hell commonly referred to as ""tropical rainforests"". Akemi was a builder and a fine one at that first prioritized building shelter for his fellow survivors. Akemi was accompanied by Kirschi a former child star that grew into a seasoned actor charming as hell and good looking to boot as well as Mal a roboticist that some considered ""too smart"".The first few days were rough. Akemi worked hard to maintain their shelter and even started to build more in order to stockpile their goods safely and even considered expanding their little domicile. He was an optimist after all and crashlanding could just mean a new beginning. He even wanted to give their home a name declaring it ""Greenhell's Oasis"". Meanwhile Mal studied further technologies and applied her intellect to research ways to improve life on this new Rimworld. Kirschi took care of keeping their area clean but grew restless as he started to experience withdrawals from his psychite addiction.For Kirschi each day without a hit of yayo was a challenge but he wouldn't break just yet. It was then that the budding colony got its first visitors some people from a nearby colony that were interested in seeing what exactly fell out of the sky. It was then that Kirschi showed what he could do. What he was born to do charm and entertain. He talked with each of the visitors and silvertongued his way into their hearts causing them to break allegiance with their colony and join his cause and his people. One of them was Skye an enforcer and while she was swooned by Kirschi's charm she saw that at his core he was an addict and that he needed help. She decided to arrest him and force him into rehab a decision that ended up being the best thing for Kirschi but caused a lot of berserk rages and psychotic breaks on the path to sobriety.Their numbers grew from three to eight and the colony began to thrive. However this angered their previous chief causing tension between them and the rising faction that crashlanded only days earlier. A move that could easily turn into a grave mistake if they decide to send raiders for a siege.However days went by then weeks then months. The colony only grew and prospered becoming wealthier and more established each day. Their numbers continued to grow from eight to ten to fifteen until one day there was an outbreak of malaria. Six colonists were infected Akemi among them and had to be forced to rest in the hospital. Lorne a recent addition to the colony was a nurse and Skye's father and he did his best to treat the condition. However when it rains it pours.A myserious plague started to ravage the populace. Twelve colonists were swept by the plague including Kirschi and Akemi as well as some others that already had malaria and only two colonists were considered healthy Lorne the nurse among them as well as Mal the roboticist.Lorne did what he could using up most of the stockpiled medicinal herbs only to find that his efforts were spread so thin trying to treat everyone that it was an impossible battle that could not be won. He wanted to break but he persevered long enough to bury his friends and his daughter Skye a real survivor that was taken too soon by a plague that Lorne couldn't cure. Lorne is a broken man now teetering on the edge of insanity often having mental breakdowns and hiding in his room.The colony is mostly deserted now with Mal being the only founder to have survived this long. Still while the colonists are beside themselves with grief they continue on. They can find new members surely and hope that such a plague doesn't come back. After all Mal now sees that they must make it off this planet and has started to research ship building and all of its intricacies. It may be some time before this happens but Mal must make sure her comrades' deaths are not in vain.It's become all too clear. They must get off this Rimworld but... Will they be able to? Or is this the place where they are all doomed to perish?",RimWorld,1,

2631,"2017-11-20",335,551,28,1,1,Had a colony GREAT colony. Had Olga the spy the ing best. I sent out a caravan to go save this guy who gets downed outside the borders. So the colony splits into two. Little did I realize only one person I left behind could fight fires Jess the cook. The caravan lead by Olga finds the dude fixes him and they get dragged back after a extra day of getting split up before returning to the colony. Meanwhile at the main base a pack of MANHUNTING RABBITS decided to swarm the colony. No big deal. All the rabbits get funneled in and get slaughtered. Acouple people get bit and have to be patched up. So lots of people are sleeping off being covered in rabbit bites. Suddenly there's a heat wave. Lots of rabbits lying in the open on the floors and people spend all night stuffing rabbits into the freezer before they rot. They go to sleep late whatever. There wasn't alot of meat left.QUEUE TRAGIC AS EVENT there is a fault in the electrical system. Dead. Center. In. The. Colony. Jess being the only one who can fight fires gets out of bed as quick as a man covered in rabbit bites can and starts putting out the fires but not before the fire has already spread into the warehouse and then subsequently to the lower housing area that happens to have wood floors and all wooden beds. Jess is attempting to fight the fires alone for hours but not before it becomes too much and begins SUPERHEATING THE ING COLONY to 1400 degrees in certain rooms. He has to take breaks running in and out of the compound as he tries in vain to fight the fire. Finally it's called to just let the colony burn. Everyone evacutes the building it can be rebuilt. But not before people get trapped inside. Colonists braving the superheated building attempting to find fallen comrades pull them outside while receiving burns from the superheated air.The caravan returns a billow of smoke is seen. The returning colonists who don't fear the fire begin fighting it as best as they can. The warehouse is lost at this point but losing the fridge would be a death sentence. They lock up in the fridge and begin putting out fires as they come. It isn't enough. They get pulled out and collapse on the ground outside those not trained in the medical arts doing their best to traige as the wounded come in. Tony doesn't make it. The combination of the colony turned crematorium with the heat wave occuring outside puts him under. He stares vacantly into the rain beating down appreciating the irony of the situation. Tony outreaches to his trusted alpaca companion Animal. He was never good at names. He came from a group of tribals. The alpaca gives a 1000 yard stare back to his human compatriot. Realizing the man who had trained him had passed Animal slips into a state similar to a man wandering in sadness. Maybe Animal being far more intelligent than humans believed granted upon a simple llama wondered what gods would cruely taunt those who needed water to extinguish the flames that consume their home in the night.The fire burned. Like a bright star on the blackest night. All the colonists could do was watch many yards away as everything they had helped to create together be consumed by the raging inferno. It would not be quick. The colony was a mountain converted into a grand residence. It took nearly the whole night until it was safe enough to stamp out the embers. The rain still pouring down on the faces of those who were barely able to move. Of Animal who stared his thousand yard alpaca stare into the smoldering ashes of what was once a home.(edited)As the fire was put out nearly every colonist was suffering from heatstroke. Olga Jess Niko Charna Charles Lucy the new colonists Malakor and Miles. They all were hurried into the freezer. Still somehow working became the new triage center. Infections from burns began to set in. Many things were lost the fire consumed all including all the weapons left behind colonists felled by the inferno. It wouldn't end well if they were attacked but luckily they all for the most part survived and had enough food and medicine to rebuild. KNOCK KNOCK Who's there? The Federation mother er.Bomb bots began flooding in from the north. Many too many. No one had time to react. Only two of the colonists were even armed at the time few guns were scattered around in the home somehow surviving the brutal flames. Olga and Malakor took a position against a few rocks as Lucy and Jess frantically searched for weapons. Olga the best shot in the whole colony readied her sniper rifle but already knew what the outcome would be. While waiting as the bots began to stride quickly across the farm fields there was a time for a brief conversation between the two. Malakor laid his hand on his husky Senaca comforting her for the last time. The conversation had a good final affect on morale as the two were swarmed and disappeared into a brilliant explosion of red mist and scrap metal. Senaca somehow survived the intial explosion but it mattered not. The Federation didn't spread so far and wide because of mercy.(edited)Lucy and Jess having retrieved weapons made their way outside but that would have been the final nail in everyone's coffin. A series of chain explosions ripped through the hallways. The structure supporting a mountain was no longer able to bear the weight as the night before left it weakened. The mountain collapsed. All those left trapped in the triage freezer perished instantly. The fields of healroot swayed. They wouldn't be needed any longer. The wind turbine would eventually fall into a state of disrepair and crumbling. Looters would come and pillage anything not nailed down. But they would return to their colonies. Speaking of a single being who survived. A lone alpaca with a saddlebag strapped to it's back. Embroidered upon it Animal.,RimWorld,1,

Just Doc Miss Farmer and Chef on a strange world.We gathered what resources we could from the wreckage and slept the night rough on the floor of a cave.The next day we started building a lavish stronghold before planting a few crops.Before we knew it the rations we scavenged were gone (should have planted crops first). So we were forced to hunt the local wildlife for food.A cry for help came over the radio. It was Doc's sister Princess she'd also survived planet fall and was being chased by raiders!We set out in force and rescue her and bring her back to the fortress. We celebrate with a hearty meal of our first crop.It turns out that Chef is a nudist. In a bid to make her more comfortable we let her spend her days o'natural. Everyone is fine with it.Our home of Fort Haven is finally finished and we start researching upgrades. Chef makes a statue of her self striding around in the nude and we use it to decorate the guest room.Another escape pod crashes down. We rescue the occupant some guy called Aiki. He's a junkie with violent tendencies.We patch up his wounds give him a hot meal and send him on his way.Both Doc and Princess catch plague! I bet it was that space junkie. They're instantly confined to bed.It take some doing but Doc treats Princess and Princess treats him.Raiders attack with half our crew bedridden with disease. We push them back but Chef is badly injured.Miss Farmer carries her back to Fort Haven and heals her wounds.Through sibling compassion and their medical know how Doc and Princess survive the plague and Chef is also restored to full health.Realising how vulnerable we are we start building defensive gun turrets. We need more metal so everyone heads off to mine.Princess doesn't like mining and for some reason she snaps. She runs around setting fires all over the place.Doc and Farmer knock her out and put her to bed but not before the fires spread taking out a huge section of forest to the North.A huge army of raiders attack. Perhaps they saw the fires? The attack our walls and devastating most of our crops. The new gun turrets come online and we mow them down.With our crops in a bad way and our food supplies low Chef recommends eating the would be raiders...A fun game.

Seriously if you're thinking about it stop thinking and just get it.In long (I guess) Here are my thoughtsPros Interesting Graphics Fun storytelling gameplay fun balance between AI control and player control generates great stories you can tell your fellow Rimworld players Great character building characters backstory and actions throughout your game can really get you attatched to them (or hate them and banish them in a fiery rage) Amazingly massive depth you can play this game in a massive variety of ways and the depth of storytelling really sucks you into the world and each one is different. You can choose to stay in one area and build a massive colony be nomadic imperailistic a crusader or try to get off the planet altogether Unique neo western esque soundtrack very good Rich sci fi lore Great developer he wrote a great book about designing games and this game is evidence that he does in fact know what he's talking about Excellent modding sceneCons I really can't think of any. There can be a couple AI bugs here and there that make your characters more stupid than you want them to be but that is rare and often just keeps things interestingAmazing game in my top 10 of all time for sure!11/10,RimWorld,1,

The ai director works well but the number of types of events is rather limited. I prefer playing in the northern climates since the summer winter cycle is interesting. There is a definite slowdown late game though and its hard to design an appealing colony without drawing too much aggro. Bionics are even worse requiring ridiculous amounts of waiting before they drop as random loot. Mods like prepare carefull help alot but lots of other mods help aswell. I look forward to more extensive product chains more balanced late game enemies better trading systems and much more room types. As is the game is rather short.

2762,"2018-02-04",0,0,15,1,1,while i do recommend the game i think the price should be adjusted to about $20 instead of $30... but this is neither here nor there.this game really is amazing. all of the AI is truly independent. you set goals and perameters for your colony to perform and they follow these but with seemingly their own individual thought. if someones priorities are adjusted a certain way they might perform construction projects regular meal cooking and hunting as needed.things can also get WAY out of hand. in one playthrough i made the mistake of settling in a very hot biome and neglecting to research cooling technology AS WELL AS neglecting to set someone as the designated meal prepper. first it became very hot making my settlers need more food but we ran out of food causing one of my settlers to RANDOMLY CANIBALIZE THE DESIGNATED DOCTOR! aaaaaaand that was the end of that campaign. sometimes it just works out that way.the biggest thing that makes this game so spectacular is the fact that each gameplay is so organically unique that it would be difficult almost impossible to reproduce a campaign multiple times. the game will certainly be different every time you play it and you set the pace and direction of what you want to happen and where you want your story to go.,RimWorld,1,

I met a young factory worker there by the name of Walls. Apparentally they had been using her face as a crude hammer at the factory because she was a powerful ugly real wrath of god type stuff. We never quite saw eye to eye as her visage was staggering but we found a way to work together for a time. She trained monkeys in our living room. To do what you ask? I haven't the faintest. Things were going well until I apparently hit some kind of quota on gagging in her presence and she began a spree of pyromania. Unfortunately we had built our home mostly of the jungle timbers. Walls burned and our walls burned. What took days to build became ash in moments.

2811,"2018-10-17",12,265,123,0,0,"Hot damn. This game is two extremes. There's just no in between. It's the best basketball game I've ever played and also one of the most frustrating. It's incredible in every sense of the word.On one hand the gameplay is freaking stellar. To say it's the best basketball game I've ever played (i.e the actual on court gameplay) is understating it... it's just absolutely great. The gameplay itself the in game presentation the graphics... it's just gorgeous.On the other hand so much of the rest of it is hot garbage. The microtransaction issue has been discussed plenty and yeah that sucks. It really makes what should be a really awesome game mode feel like a chintzy cash grab. And generally speaking many of the menu systems are a convoluted mess. But those aren't even its biggest problems. Because even with all of that I would still be recommending this game. Just based on gameplay alone it's great. Personally I love playing franchise mode on sports games so the whole microtransaction headache really doesn't come into play for me. The menu headaches I can deal with once I figure out the system.But! The game's so freaking buggy I keep losing save files to corruption. As someone who likes to play franchises over long periods of time that renders this game more or less useless to me until its fixed. And it's not like this is a launch day issue this thing's been out over a month now. And a quick perusal of forums and blogs and etc shows I'm not the only one having this problem and there's no shortage of other bugs being reported and 2k is apparently so swamped with tech support requests they're taking over a week to reply if they're replying at all. Don't waste your money. I saw the $40 sale and thought ""what the heck "" but honestly 2k doesn't deserve your money.Editing this to add experiences after a couple of months in the game my impressions haven't changed overall. It's the best and worst thing ever.The myPlayer microtransaction moneygrab thing... honestly if they'd like made it SLIGHTLY easier less grindey it would be awesome. As it is you pretty much have to spend $10 20. If you do that the game's fine. If you don't? It's a slog. Your player will suck for a really long time and improving is a slow and painful process. You really have to grind.But hey at least your myCareer save file doesn't corrupt... unlike franchise save files which they still haven't fixed. For me franchise files have corrupted no joke 9 out of 10 times. That's out of 10 times I tried to start a franchise 9 of them corrupted the first time I saved and closed the game then opened it up again. (The one time it didn't the first time it corrupted the second time I saved and re opened. WOOOOO.) Contacting 2K support was a joke. I sent them as much system and error info as I could and it took them 2 weeks just to send me a clearly automated form email giving me troubleshooting tips... for a console. Like... you have to work to be that bad. And no your ""we're sorry we're so slow we're buried under emails from people who hate this game"" is not a good excuse but thanks for playing. Honestly I just remain amazed by this game. For the on court experience it's the best basketball game I've ever played and maybe the best sports game I've ever played. But literally everything else the bugs the laughably bad menus the money the painfully bad customer service etc has pretty much convinced me to never give 2K a dime again.One final edit I finally got the save files working. I don't think it was anything 2k19 did if you search for some combination of ""2k19 file corruption"" you'll find a thread on the Steam community forums pointing you to where the save files are located I followed that advice and got it working. So now I'm playing my franchise mode and I'm overally pretty happy.I'm still not recommending this game because holy crap I shouldn't have to fix your bugs for you.",NBA 2K19,1,

2815,"2018-09-27",6,424,110,0,0,Gambling and pay2win is not ok stop it alreadyAnother year another sports game. So I ll start by saying that I m not going to give a positive review for a game which has the most blatant pay2win model gambling and selling cheats.NBA 2k19 is an improvement over the last game. You may not notice that by just watching videos but when you spend some time playing it you see it s quite different.Graphics are pretty much the same maybe players look a little better. But some player are like from PS2 era. I know that making every player look god is a long and difficult job but with releasing the game every year and getting insane profits each year it s possible to do.Animations are nice and this time game relies less on them. It is still animation based but now you have more control over your player.Another improvement which I consider the biggest one is when you re open you re really open. No more just standing behind the player who shoots and it registered as contested shot. You must stand in front of the player and put your hands up to contest the shot. So finally you can pass the ball to an open player and shoot right away while defending man is behind you or on the side or just standing in front of you but does nothing to contest. Unfortunately this has a downside. Because it s really easy to get open shots the game may become three point shooting contest.Defense is improved too. You still drive to the basket but often it ends with a climbing into the tree than a successful layup. So it s better to rely on other way to score. Defense is much more effective this year.I had no problems with performance game runs fine on max settings and looks great.I play MyTeam and MyCareer mode mainly. Both are p2w and infested with cheaters. The game has no anticheat. They only ban cheaters who cheat the currency.MyTeam this time is better and worse at the same time. It s better because you can get some decent players at the beginning and if you know the game you can be pretty competitive. They have added tokens this year which you can earn by simply playing the game online and offline then use those tokens to purchase player cards. And to be honest you can get a lot of ruby cards for cheap from the auction just for a few thousand MT each so building a competitive team is pretty fast.Now why it is worse? The auction is locked. To unlock it you MUST win and online triple threat(3vs3) game. This was possible at day one when most people had poor player cards but it s impossible to do if you bought the game later when everyone has the best players already. There are two outcomes to this you either spend money on VC to buy good player cards or you simply don t play MyTeam because without an auction it s pointless.And again like any other year there are cheaters who if losing just makes the game not count. Of course this doesn t involve cheating VC so 2K doesn t care they doesn t care about bad experiences glitches or bug but if VC glitch is discovered they patch it in a few days.Now another thing about MyTeam. I know it s fun to build your team of super stars but in the end it s boring. Everyone has the best players everyone has almost the same players. Every player can shoot mid range dunk or three pointers. And it s no fun either you win or lose. I wish we could have a separate mode(or this done in the current unlimited mode) where we would be forced to use some crappy cards like bronze silver gold emerald. This would force people to use each player s strength s and for opponent to find the weaknesses this would make people to think to plan in other words to play basketball like it supposed to be played. Now we have every player good at everything which isn't fun.MyCareer is awesome if you play single player. Finally we ve got some nice story mode. Last year I wanted to skip all the cut scenes because it was boring. This year we can skip them but I don t want to do that because are very well done and are interesting to watch. I wish some rpg games had facial animations so good. You start as a player in a Chinese basketball league and make your way up to NBA. You can see how your player struggles how hard he s working and wants to get into NBA. Really good job 2K.To make your player better you must earn VC and upgrade him. And with the ability to buy VC we all know where it leads when it comes to online play.Of course there are many more modes in this game. There s a lot of content for both single player and multiplayer. There s an online mode Play now which isn t affected by p2w mechanics so you can enjoy that at least and know if you win or lose it was only because of your skill.In conclusion I recommend to buy this game but don t buy any VC I mean any not even one time not even the cheapest option. Doing this we show them that the game is good but we are not ok with p2w and gambling.Pros Improved gameplayGood graphicsLots of content for both single player and multiplayerMyCareer mode is greatCons Gambling and pay2win bsSome players look really badNo anti cheatLocked auction in MyTeamMy curator page,NBA 2K19,1,

2817,"2019-02-14",6,163,120,0,0,"I'd like to preface my review by saying that I've only played My Career the other modes don't appeal to me.The actual gameplay (although it still has flaws questionable AI at times and some serious cheese) is great... for a while. My Career should really be called ""My 1st season"" because you'll end up so bored of the seemingly scripted games (Up by 10? Get subbed out for the whole quarter and put back in down 18) you'll reach the playoffs that 1st year and it will more like a chore than enjoyment.Win rookie of the year? No cutscene.NBA All star weekend? 0 cutscenes or fanfare just a normal game and a sub par dunk contest.The lowest of the low is the progression system in My Career. It's perhaps the most predatory piece of game development I've ever seen. You start off and you suck that's to be expected. But you suck so much that you can't make open layups you can't pass without turning the ball over and you handle like I do in real life. Then a little voice in your head goes.... ""I can spend another 40 bucks and actually start to play like an NBA player... I can actually enjoy this game"". So you check your bank account and see that you can stretch to 40 bucks it's a hobby I enjoy why the not?So you spend 40 bucks on an already pricey game and then you feel dirty sure you can start racking up some numbers on the stat sheet hitting some sweet swishes and breaking ankles... but you've just basically bought you're enjoyment. Without that initial investment (or arduous grind for an obscene amount of hours) this game isn't fun. It's designed to be frustrating. It's designed to get you to pay more money for that quick dopamine fix. It's predatory and deplorable.Avoid this game like the plague don't be a like me and spend money on imaginary coins just to enjoy a product you've already paid money for.",NBA 2K19,1,

After first walkthrough ( for Claire ) I was absolutely sure that RE2 Remake will be the best game of 2019 but after second one I saw some troubles. It's subjectively and of course only my problems.a Same combinations for all safes &amp doors ( I wrote down all the tips and keys in a notepad ) so there wasn't a excitement to find it during the second walkthrough.b) At second scenario Tyrant doesn't scare at all. He gets noisy and loud but not scary and boring.c) For some reason I was absolutely sure that the scenarios would be really different from each other cause it's 2019th triple A game and exciting plots + lots of content are modern standard but the difference is ridiculous like at 1998.But I also have a two extra scenarios for each character + future DLC so I hope it will be more diverse.

This is Capcom back to their roots with a classic quality title. There is always tension mystery anticipation and important decisions to make. It feels as if every item placement and encounter are carefully handcrafted to leave you with the feeling of despair. There are many surprises that motivate you to keep playing and you're always curious to explore new areas from the puzzle you just solved. Dying never feels bad because the game pulls no punches and allows you to bring valuable knowledge for your next run.Took me way longer than I thought to beat the first campaign in hardcore mode which I believe is the only way to play the game.

2855,"2019-02-02",0,0,16,0,1,"I am apprehensive about thumbs upping this game because I definitely don't think it deserves a 96%+ positive rating. It's extremely overpriced for what it is which is unfortunate because the game honestly is pretty decent. I'm reviewing this game as it is. I don't recall much about the original I played it forever ago when I was like 12. So I know a lot of people will defend the faults by saying it's true to the original. Graphically mechanically and cinematically the game is amazing for sure. I think the gameplay is nostalgic of the horror games in the 90's and 2000's. Not because of the mechanics but just the level design and the progression pacing. I think it did a damn good job hitting the right feels in that department. I think it's also a graphically gorgeous game with some great level design. I have some legitimate gripes beyond that though... Firstly. I think it's ridiculous that they have these side character missions. Both play off stupid gender stereotypes (Claire gets to be mommy and Leon gets to be distracted by an FBI woman who doesn't know how to dress appropriately for her job) but that's basically it. There are parts in both the storylines where you get to play these distracting side characters in this subplot sort of scenario. And I barely see the point in the two side characters at all. The FBI Agent was far less infuriating than the child by a long shot. The child's little side mission is so irritating it took me twenty minutes to figure out where I was supposed to hide because there was literally only one place you could do it. That was totally worthless. Leon is the epitome of a dumb blonde. Not the trained police officer one would expect. Claire is basically a piece of cardboard but her interactions at least felt more realistic. Leon's forced last minute romance with the FBI Agent was totally ridiculous. He met her for literally like twenty minutes and then he's so distracted by her boobs that he starts acting like a complete moron. And I get that the Agent's outfit was an homage to the original but that doesn't really make it any less obnoxious. I'm glad they had enough sense to change up Claire's outfit to be more practical and less annoying. The plot is honestly the worst part of the game. And I know I'm gonna get a lot of hate from the RE community but RE has barely ever patchworked together a cohesive plot in its entire run as a franchise. I'm not gonna get into it because I am trying not to spoil everything but the way the characters act about the crisis that's happening around them is so stupid and unbelievable it's not even funny. I very very rarely say that a game's gameplay and graphics make up for its bad characters and plot but honestly I can't help but enjoy playing this game. I really think it's worth something more like $30 at most though. You can replay after you beat each story in a New Game + to get different endings but I don't really see why you'd want to grind through the game to get those. RE7 was absolute trash and I am glad that the RE team made this game more challenging they made resources more scarce and they rewarded accuracy in shooting. I thought they were making zombies HP tanks like they did in 7 to try to make up for the abundance in ammo but I very quickly realized I was just an extremely bad shot and that ammo is actually pretty damn scarce. It felt like a real survival game though the HP items were waaaaay too abundant. I think the RE team needs to steer more towards Silent Hill and less towards typical shooters. But that's just my opinion on the franchise. Overall I'd give this game about a 7.5/10. It's not quite an 8 for me but it's definitely not horrible. I had fun playing and it did feel very nostalgic. But if one more person said ""Go on without me Leon I'll just slow you down "" I would've docked another point. Lol.",RESIDENT EVIL 2 / BIOHAZARD RE:2,1,
2856,"2019-02-03",0,0,36,0,1,Simply amazing. My only gripe is how the 2nd story ends up going through many of the same areas and puzzles as the first playthrough. Although there's a decent amount of new areas and experiences so it's not like you're playing everything twice over. After finishing the 4th survivor on the skin of my teeth Tofu survivor has become such a comedic relief. I certainly hope they keep up with additional content. This is definitely my favorite title this year. If they can remake every title up to Resident Evil 4 this well I'd fall back in love with the Biohazard series like many of us were until 6.,RESIDENT EVIL 2 / BIOHAZARD RE:2,1,

I only have 2 things I dont love 100% in this game and thats the Tyrant and that Knifes break but these are small things. The Tyrant is well done for most parts but he can become pretty annoying when he just refuses to leave the place you have to cross... The Knife thing is... well its ok considering the new use of knifes as ""Get out of Jail free"" Items but its somehow strange since the knife was always such a trusted weapon in the RE games and now its just a consumable item...

2876,"2019-01-25",26,801,21,0,1,"In A Nutshell Pros + An incredible remake. Everything was remade from scratch using RE7's engine delivering top notch graphics quality.+ Two parallel stories to play Claire's and Leon's.+ Plenty of hidden items weapons and secrets to find with exploration rewarding attentive and careful players.+ True old school survival horror experience players need to be extremely conservative with resources and avoid combat when possible.+ Varied challenging gameplay situations that keep the experience fresh from start to end.+ Higher difficulties provide considerable challenge even to veterans of the genre. Cons The ""Ink"" mechanic (enabling game saving only with a certain consumable) on Hardcore difficulty should be optional as not all players might like it but still would like the additional challenge compared to Normal. First of all it has to be said that this is a Remake with capital R as everything was remade from scratch models textures lighting even the engine was completely changed to the excellent one used for RE7. As far as looks goes RE2 delivers astonishing graphical detail giving a true 2019 worthy look to this great game of old.For those not knowing it RE2 is an old school survival horror quite a bit different from the more recent chapters. Impersonating either Leon or Claire players will have to carve their way through zombie infested police stations putrid sewers and even worse places. What really changes is how they do this as RE2 is a ""pure"" survival horror game favoring extreme conservation of resources for when they truly matter (boss fights or unavoidable normal fights) while encouraging players to be creative and avoid as many unnecessary fights as possible as one would do in a real apocalypse after all.Exploration is rewarding and satisfying for the attentive players that do want to explore every corner open every locker crack every safe lock they find and examine items they find to reveal secrets. Not only this is rewarded with ever needed resources but aswell weapons and objects such as additional inventory space or weapon upgrades. And believe me when i say until the last bullet will be needed to make it through this horror so better start looking! Combat features detailed dismemberment mechanics such as mutilating an enemy's legs to slow it down or hitting weak points to stagger it momentarily and run past. Overall this remake of RE2 is an excellent survival horror only quite different than what most players are used to nowadays and thus needs to be understood to fully enjoy it. Still to those willing to understand how its mechanic work it can deliver an unforgettable experience for this genre as only a few other masterpieces can do. It's actually a game I have been happy to pay full price for. In depth Feature Analysis Gameplay Gameplay in RE2 is divided into Exploration Management and Combat.Exploration is performed with a 3rd person visual featuring mouse based aiming sprint/walk and plenty of interactions with the environment such as using specific tools to open pathways barricade windows or opening lockers and containers to gather loot. Attention to detail and backtracking are fundamental in this game as many areas will be only accessible as more and more tools and keys are gathered so going back to already explored places is actually meaningful even if optional as it often leads to great rewards for those willing to risk it.Management is a fundamental mechanic in any survival horror but especially in RE2. Inventory space especially at the beginning without expansions is very limited so either going back often to the Stash to store items or a wise optimization of resources are needed at all times. Combining herbs ammo stacks and decide what to take or leave behind are things players will do often in this title. With the presence of a global stash however it's just a matter of storing surplus into it often when accessible. However balancing the loadout in ammo healing items and weapons is important and doing it wrong can lead to not having enough space for critical items. Story The story in RE2 is divided into two parallel campaigns and its lore is narrated via pieces of information found scattered around cut scenes and dialogues with various characters. The narrative is solid decently written and engaging from start to end. Characters have all strong defined personalities and are interesting aswell. For not being the strong side of these titles definitely good. Combat System Combat in RE2 is tactical pretty much slow paced and based upon accuracy preparation and knowing each enemy's skills and weaknesses. The best offense in this game is... to avoid combat. That's right try to kill every enemy and soon all ammo will run out leaving players defenseless and doomed in case of mandatory fights. Instead careful planning of routes engagements is vital to save up the spare resources for when they truly matter.Still then it comes to it each weapon has good and diverse feeling to it while enemies react beautifully to shots in a shower of gore most of the time. Enemies are considerably tougher than most of nowadays games of the same genres so beware. This might seem as a CON at first... but once understanding the game's concept it becomes a good side of it. Content &amp Pricing Priced at 60 and lasting (depends on play style difficulty and experience GREATLY) around 10 16 hours this is one of the VERY FEW titles i can recommend getting at FULL PRICE. The quality it delivers is simply too good to be missed. Balance &amp Challenge This is not an easy game by any means and players can even be forced to restart because of having wasted too many resources. But once understood it delivers amazing satisfactions. Challenge level is medium/high. Technical Analysis Graphics Astonishing. RE7's engine improved even more with a plethora of modern effects filters and settings to tweak and top quality textures models animations and effects makes for one gorgeous title. Possibly one of the games with the best graphics around considering it's a remake. Sound Excellent ambient sounds effects and voice acting. Directional sounds also featuring binaural audio for better realism deliver excellent quality that contributes immensely to immersion. Performance &amp Stability The game runs without issues in 1440p with maxed out settings 3GB textures and 120% quality on the following config i7 4820K GTX1080 16GB RAM . No performance or optimization problems to note. Artificial Intelligence Enemy AI is not that brilliant considering most enemies are mutants or zombies. As expected. The few ""intelligent"" enemies follow patterns of movement through the maps and chase players on sight. Quality of Life Good interface and menu handling without any issue for the genre. Bugs &amp Issues Nothing major to report. Great polishing and refinement. Conclusion RE2 is really a gem of the old times brought back to life with modern technology. One of the best remade versions I have ever seen on the market and truly worth every cent.Follow our curator page OCG Curations if you like and want to see more reviews like this one.",RESIDENT EVIL 2 / BIOHAZARD RE:2,1,
2877,"2019-01-31",5,198,23,0,1,This game has me emotional in a way I can t explain. I ve loved the Resident Evil series with a fiery passion ever since I played my very first entry with Code Veronica X on the PS2. After I finished playing the hell out of that game I devoured every Resident Evil title I could get my hands on and was a dedicated fan (even wrote my share of fan fiction) all the way up until Resident Evil 6 which thoroughly ripped my heart to shreds with what the series had become. While RE7 was something of a return to form despite the first person perspective it was missing the one thing I loved so much about these games the characters. I didn't realize until now how badly I missed my time with them but stepping into Leon S. Kennedy and Claire Redfield s shoes again felt like coming home.https //steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id 1639405393That said I was terrified that like so many overly hyped high profile titles these days that Resident Evil 2 would stumble and miss the mark. But let me tell you they nailed it. THEY NAILED IT! Granted the story has been somewhat simplified and the B scenarios feel rushed and a bit tacked on (likely a result of the devs not wanting to disappoint the fans when word leaked that they wouldn t be included) but those are miniscule grievances when the rest of the game is so supremely satisfying. Everything that I loved about the series is back and it all looks sounds and feels so good that I m literally getting choked up right now just typing this.Even the swap to over the shoulder camera feels fitting and natural and I ve long been a champion of fixed camera angles. But the way the action is framed the long dark endless corridors the creatures that lurk in the shadows the terrifying sounds they make it all makes up for the loss. Fortunately the characters don t move with quite as much agility as they do in post RE4 titles either. There s no dodge button no quick time events no counterattacks. If you re grabbed by a zombie you either shove a grenade down its throat or suffer the consequences. This heightens the suspense tremendously. No matter how heinous the foe you need to tread carefully and wisely.https //steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id 1640404534And that's not even mentioning how much better the writing and acting is. The dialogue actually sounds somewhat believable albeit cliche at times and the interactions between characters are so much more organic than they used to be (thank goodness there s no I love you moment ) All of this is elevated by the voice actors giving great performances which really help bring these characters to life. We already know who bad super agent Leon S. Kennedy is but it s refreshing watching the rookie cop become the man we all know and love.I honestly could continue gushing about the game for several more paragraphs but there s already thousands of reviews that ll say the exact same thing. So I ll just say this if you re an old school Resident Evil fan and you can get past the modernization of a classic then you need to play this game. YOU NEED IT! This is old school survival horror in a gorgeous new wrapping and every bit as good as the original.Curated by Chudah's Corner,RESIDENT EVIL 2 / BIOHAZARD RE:2,1,

2889,"2019-02-04",0,0,30,0,1,Great game! No doubt about that. Brings forth the feel of the original but in the 21st century! The game play is great and the graphics are even better. I would totally recommend it. HOWEVER Read below my in site on what I did not like.My only gripe about it is reply value.We all know about that IGN review that says 2nd run is basically the same as the 1st run through and everyone gave them crap because of that review... well to be fair they really weren't that far off. I just finished playing through both Leon and Claire's 1st and 2nd run throughs and honestly... I was bored of the game before I finished my 1st 2nd run through with Leon. Other then where you start off and some item locations (which that is even rare) and a minor twist to the end of the story everything was basically the same.I was not impressed with the minor changes in the run throughs. It was simply not changed enough and I was still replying the same sectors just in a different manner (as in used the door earlier or later then previous run through or starting on the other side of the station) the results end up being the same you still have to go through the same puzzles and same rooms to get the same items to clear and move onto the next sector...I know this is basically how the original was too but for a full priced game. I was hoping for more replay value. (maybe we will get that with the up coming free DLC)And survival mode is a cool idea but again nothing new here no new areas to play in etc... it just spawns you at the end of the game with Hunk and you have to run through everything but backwards to get to the evac point... Great? I beat the survival aspect in my first try... so that was fun while it lasted?Either way its a good game and highly recommend it. Just dont invest a crazy amount of time in the other run throughs. You might be disappointed in what you find.,RESIDENT EVIL 2 / BIOHAZARD RE:2,1,

2899,"2019-02-04",0,0,37,0,1,After a little less than thirty hours I have just completed the 2019 version of Resident Evil 2 (unlocking all achievements in the process) and am now searching for words to convey how I feel without sounding like too much of fanboy. Truth be told and despite the fact that I really did enjoy the franchise s new spin through a brilliant and successful 7th entry nostalgia has always kept the 2nd and 4th entries very close to my heart both of which I have always considered the true epitome of the franchise s atmosphere and gameplay respectively.Claiming that said entries left a lasting impression on my gaming career as a younger man would be a massive understatement and so I am bound to cover this REmake with praise it being nothing short of a perfect fusion of my two favourite entries.. and probably even more than the sum of its parts. I'm not going to insult your intelligence lingering on the technical side of things (the game is just beautiful and runs well there is nothing more to add) or on the outdated gameplay (which remains more or less similar to that of RE4 and 5) or even on the nonsensical b movie plot (which nevertheless retains its timeless cheesy charm).What I would emphasize instead is that this game has a soul uncannily similar to its 1998 source material perfectly capturing what made that game legendary in the first place whilst simultaneously improving upon it dramatically creating a new beast altogether in the process.This game turned the clock back 21 years when I played Resident Evil 2 on PS1 for the first time thoroughly impressed by it all and just happy to experience such a great ride which is basically the reason why I love video games so much. So yeah.. just buy and play the damn game already. This one gets my highest recommendation.,RESIDENT EVIL 2 / BIOHAZARD RE:2,1,
2900,"2019-02-04",0,0,31,0,1,The game runs smoothly and looks amazing. The same engine used from RE7 was used for this game.For a remake it's everything a fan of the series could ask for.There are 4 main campaigns in the game. Leon A/B (first and second run) and Claire A/B (first and second run). It took me approximately 10 hours to complete Leon A and 6 hours for Claire A. Now I'm on the second run of their campaigns and it's quite different already within the first few minutes it changes what you already know about the game and it takes you out of your comfort zone and forces you to explore again.The controls feel natural. For a horror game its definitely one of the best. I played Leon A on regular difficulty and it worked out to be a bit of a challenge I didn't die once since I'm already familiar with the series and game's mechanics from the demo but that doesn't take away from the experience. I was constantly scared of the next corner or next zombie encounter because I barely had a full clip for my guns. The clues and items you find throughout the game are worth paying attention to as they help you progress further. The puzzles were not too hard as to make you quit as long as you're somewhat patient and pay attention to how the puzzle should be solved. That being said the game is great for fans of the series and horror game enthusiasts. However if you've never played the earlier games such as RE1 2 3 then you may struggle progressing through the game without a guide because the game plays differently to most modern games it doesn't exactly hold your hand or specifically tell you where to go no waypoints nothing. Some tips are to look at the map and see which rooms have been explored or not EXAMINE the key items you collect (keys boxes etc). I'd highly recommend this game it's not for the faint hearted but where's the fun of it your heart pumping and adrenaline rushing. Also it's just a game zombies aren't real D10/10 it's the only good horror game I've played since dead space.,RESIDENT EVIL 2 / BIOHAZARD RE:2,1,

Still chared me a ton for costumes and usless guns (these would be free unlock sin past). 7 out of 10 wait till cheap as 8 hours max play I did both campaigns in 7 hours at one point in police station back and forth I was starting to get bored was interesting when Tyrant showed up but then a pain having to go long way to avoid him (scary foot steps). And Caires story finishes it off nicely but 50% same quests. Leon has been here and unlocked the door so why I got to do it lame spoils game so about 4 5 hours content and I wom't replay. Nice cut scenes and worth a play through but at 20 not full price. And had some great memories and seeing how far graphics has come is amazing they did a great job at Capcom but its 2019 and I expect more game for my money. I would have paid 10 oor 15 more if they had Claire do unique missions and some of the new areas in concept art amd Res Evil 3 as part of a complete package.

2934,"2019-01-29",0,0,17,0,1,"Awesome game and a benchmark on how a remake should be done. It's RE2 at its core without any of that t other companies tried to pull of. Compared to the original it provides no significant changes in gameplay or story and there are only a few changes in the level design but those do reduce backtracking quite a bit. Still the slight changes that have been made are interesting and provide a good mix up. People who know the original RE2 by heart will immediately feel at home in Racoon City but even they will see a few new things.The best part of this game however is its presentation The sound design is amazing. From little things like the sound of your boots on the ground to the more important ones like the music ore the well known Zombies that scream and moan... Still even the sound is outclassed by the graphics. I can't stress enough how impressed I am with the damn graphics! The game always looks amazing and at certain parts it even manages to look real. Now that's not something I say often and I even think that videogames should concentrate on their own visual style rather than trying to recreate reality but RE2 does concentrate on its own style and achieves the photorealism along the way by having an incredible attention to detail. Faces and clothing look impressive rain looks awesome animations are fluid and believable... Everything is spot on. Capcom even took the time to add facial expression to the characters so that they squinch their faces when injured. Considering the game is played in an over the shoulder perspective so you might not never realize your character is doing this it only shows how much Capcom cared about the details here.There is only one thing that might put you off The game can be a bit short. Since there are two playable main characters it provides you with two campaigns that offer just enough differences between them to count as seperate and only playing both of them will let you see the whole story. After finishing the game once you can then start a ""2nd Run"" which basically is kinda New Game Plus and only this mode let's you see the true ending. Again finish 2nd Run once and you can start to play additional modes that don't offer much new except very tough challenges. Now if you're a completionist you will probably play the normal game twice and then the 2nd Run twice too because 2nd Run makes the enemies tougher changes the location of items and weapons and starts you off a fair bit into the game by skipping the Prologue and the arrival in Raccon City. If you're in it for the story however you might not be interested in playing the game four times and after you've played it once with a character you can then start the 2nd Run with the other. This way will let you see the whole story and the good ending in about 15 to 17 hours.So if you're gonna play it several times the game is definitely worth every penny. If not however full price might not be a good idea since you will pay almost sixty bucks for 15 hours of gameplay. I still wholeheartedly recommend RE2 to everyone but those who are in it to see the story and don't plan on playing it several times (or simply don't have the time to do that) might want to think about waiting for a sale.",RESIDENT EVIL 2 / BIOHAZARD RE:2,1,

2938,"2019-02-05",0,0,17,0,1,This is a perfect example of a gaming masterpiece and is easily the best remake I have ever played far surpassing the original title. The graphics atmosphere and positional audio is terrifying in the most enjoyable of ways (You can hear every growl click clack and shriek near you while the music builds tension constantly in dangerous areas) and the map designs are superb rewarding players for foresight in carrying certain items or approaching puzzles in a specific way. Many parts of the game offer you an opportunity to save ammo by boarding windows or doing certain things to prevent zombies from becoming a problem later. Carefully choosing your battles and the path you take through the police station will reward you greatly later and extra puzzles are always worth the effort to solve.The story is engrossing even to those who have already seen the original as it is very well retold and area layouts have changed significantly enough it feels like a brand new game.This should absolutely be a purchase for anyone who enjoys survival horror games atmospheric scary titles and great games in general.,RESIDENT EVIL 2 / BIOHAZARD RE:2,1,

My only advice is for people who are worried about not having enough content there is definitely enough to enjoy the game many many times. You cannot compare the scale of this to an online shooter or a sandbox RPG because it's nothing like those games. The value of this game is the same as when you play a story driven single player that you binge for a while and if you like it enough (like most fans) you'll go back to the game later simply because you love the game not because theres more to do.

2951,"2019-01-31",0,0,23,0,1,I'm simply blown away by how good of a REmake this is. The enemy design within the game works out great and you always feel a tinge of danger even when facing basic enemies like the regular zombies but full blown anxiety attacks when you screw up while fighting or fleeing from bigger threats like Lickers Mr. Birken or Mr. X. Speaking of Mr. X he's best scary snazzy looking antagonist I've seen in a game in years. His unstoppable nature large figure and stomping footsteps let you know he's a major threat from the get go and seeing him remastered after all these years in such a great way really makings me want to hug the whole team who put together this REmake.I haven't even mentioned the sound design which is critically important to good horror. The ambient sounds enemy sounds and even the sounds of the protagonists panting and cursing are all so well done! Take note developers this is what you should strive for when designing sound for your horror games.This is beyond a faithful REmake this was better than what I could have hoped for.With the massive success RE 2 is seeing I'm almost certain I'll be able to experience RE 3 remade using very similar assests in the near future. With how they handled modeling Mr. X I can't wait to see how they'll recreate Nemesis.Oh and I wouldn't mind a RE4 remake with more content added in a few years either. I played it for hundreds of hours as a teenager and would certainly dive into it again given the chance.,RESIDENT EVIL 2 / BIOHAZARD RE:2,1,

2960,"2019-02-07",0,0,65,0,1,One of my favorite game series and possibly my favorite overall hits its peak with this remake. What was previously my favorite game of the original gameplay style and inventory focused structure is remade with painstaking attention to detail in order to keep it faithful to the original feel and focus while updating it to modern standards. They absolutely nailed it. There were certain aspects that I thought might have been an issue if implemented in a sloppy manner and it's clear the designers programmers and even writers and scene directors were very aware of this as well. They made sure nothing ruined the experience. Luckily it also runs perfectly on PC just as RE7 did.I last closed the game earlier today having completed every unlockable based objective of which there are around 70 including speed runs inventory limited playthroughs extra mission modes etc. I also completed the extra objective of getting an S+ rank (requiring limited saves) with both Claire and Leon (each character comes across a unique set of primary weapons and sidearms) one on each campaign variant . Since I played RE4 on the week of release for Gamecube I've considered it my favorite game ever with RE2 and recently RE7 tied for a far second place in the series. I can't say for certain right now but this remake is definitely giving it a tofu run for its money.,RESIDENT EVIL 2 / BIOHAZARD RE:2,1,
2961,"2019-02-07",0,0,17,0,1,I only have 17 hours played but it was enough time for me to get through the A runs of both Leon and Claire and I couldn't be more excited to do the B runs.This game does survival horror perfectly. No constant jump scares every 2 seconds. The eerie feeling of walking down a dark hallway also while there is a bunch of creepy noises from creaking water dripping zombies moaning. Not knowing where said noises are coming from making you scared and hesitant to turn every corner keeping you on edge but also worrying about what resources you have left gives this game one of the best atmospheres I've ever experienced.The way the game sets all the puzzles works amazing not too complicated but not too easy. Leaving the answers scattered throughout the game making you truly explore the areas to make sure you haven't missed anything. Having these puzzles also allows for a good implementation of backtracking. Finding a puzzle early game to find the answer mid way through making you go back through an area you've been through already but that zombie you didn't kill is still there giving the backtracking a different experience each time.The inventory is one of the best mechanics of the game. Giving you exactly what you need to get through an area but not too much so it makes you contemplate is using these bullets/health item/grenade worth it right now or should I save them for later?. Having limited spaces engages you in inventory management. This also falls into the exploration part too from the first paragraph about puzzles. These items being so precious also encourages you to explore every nook and cranny of the game really giving it that survival feel.The game looks beautiful as well. The lighting shadows textures insane detail in gore. Only down side I had was some micro stuttering travelling from one area to a new one. Especially in the main hall of the police station but it was something I could play through and isn't warranted giving this game a negative review. l felt like I was engaged in the story and wasn't missing out on anything. I understood what was happening from start to finish. Each character had their own personality that stood out and was unique to themselves and all had a role to play all the way to the end. Some of the voice acting was a bit odd but you could tell they were trying to keep that original voice acting and I loved it.Overall this game takes it's basic mechanics improves on them without taking away that original feel but gives it that modernised look you get in today's games. 100% recommend to anyone old fans new to the series and want a way to get introduced. There is so much more that is great about this game that I haven't written in this review. There is just too much to write about. 10/10 must buy.,RESIDENT EVIL 2 / BIOHAZARD RE:2,1,

2975,"2019-01-31",0,0,84,0,1,A proper remake of a great classic. The classic RE2 is one of my favorite sequals in the RE franchise and this remake did not disappoint whatsoever. If anyone is thinking of picking up this game I would highly recommend playing on the hardcore difficulty to truely experience this masterpiece.Here's to hoping the RE3 remake is in the works.,RESIDENT EVIL 2 / BIOHAZARD RE:2,1,
2976,"2019-02-01",0,0,19,0,1,(VERY MILD SPOILERS AHEAD)Resident Evil 2 Remake is an example of the modern hype train over a genuinely good product going overboard and turning it into a God.Let s clear two things up categorically this is a fun fun game and a worthy remake but it is neither as good as the original nor as good as the disgracefully underrated Resident Evil Remake.Let s start with the basics remaking RE2 is a true sign that despite the end product s quality that Capcom are completely out of ideas and have resorted to remaking sequels in order to find something new. And the fact the game is pretty darn good justifies their lack of imagination.But I do wonder when this series will be permanently shelved RE7 was good it was but not very RE y while this one is good it is but doesn t really capture the feel and vibe of the original games.For example RE Remake absolutely captured the 96 original plus massively improved on every aspect that time dictated need a new lick of paint. It is for me hands down by far the best video game remake in history. I didn t expect this one to match it and it didn t.What is good about RE2? It s a fun stand alone survival horror which feels like Outlast in places and RE7 in others it is visually decent if not stunning and the gameplay is the RE Engine gameplay the series has evolved into it is not the gameplay of the originals even if you think it is. It like RE7 feels disconnected from the earlier games but even though that is a bit disappointing it s not the end of the world.One review made a very fair point the new police station isn t well designed. I don t like the new stairs in the lobby and the navigation is horrific it is not intuitive and the frequent backtracking is a nightmare.I also dislike the hoops you have to jump through to get the magnum I didn t get it completed the game without it but blow me if I didn t expect it to be given to me as part of the game. No turns out you have to bend over backwards to earn it and I don t really agree with that. I also don t agree with making chief Irons office non standard plot either. I didn t find the club key on my first playthrough so didn t get to see the backstory there.But this didn t ruin the game I know it sounds like a hating review I really did enjoy this game but it in no way captured the magic of the original RE2 and a lot of the changes it made were frankly unnecessary. It s a good game in its own right but it s perhaps a little overrated perhaps others were expecting something different to myself but I wanted to play a game which felt like the game it was remaking rather than a RE Engine contemporary take on it.It didn t feel like I was in Raccoon City it didn t feel like Umbrella s Lab and it didn t actually feel like Leon Kennedy not that I mind because he is the most boring and overused protagonist in the series history anyway give me Jill Chris and Barry any day.It also bothered me that Leon's scenario saw very little interaction with Claire unlike the original for example no Sherrie in Leon's till the end and her character being made kind of irrelevant in his first playthrough.There was also a slight 'bug' whereby the 'so far' summary on the loading screen was illegible because it loaded too fast to read!I also wasn't fond of the rejiggling of the order of game aspects and I didn't really like the change in the gun shop owner's character.But back on the point the game is good very good it has its faults (zombie bullet sponges are just old and completely idiotic by now) for sure and anyone thinking this game is perfect has very different standards to me. But it isn t RE. RE will always be the original 90s games 2001 s RE Remake and more recent HD remaster nailed the old feeling while bringing it into the present. This one just doesn t.But I d still recommend it anyway.,RESIDENT EVIL 2 / BIOHAZARD RE:2,1,

I still remember the suspense I felt the first time a licker crawled across the window. Capcom has brought all of that back in full force.I understand this is a remake but I would gladly recommend this to anyone whether they are RE veterans or people that are new to the series. The graphic are gorgeous. The voice acting phenomenal. The suspense unnerving. This is the way that Resident Evil is supposed to be.

3008,"2019-02-07",0,0,35,0,1,Anyone else notice Capcom crushing other major publishers lately? Last year's Monster Hunter World and Mega Man 11 the upcoming DMC 5 and then there's THIS game. Damn this game. RE 2 made me realize why public facilities need wider corridors. Liked Game looks pretty all things considered. All backed up by good performance. True Survival Horror. Finished it in hardcore mode just a while ago. I think this is the first time I actually had to conserve ammo on a game like this making a bullet count not by hitting the right area of an enemy but actually saving it for a bigger threat later on. The music new and old(got the dlc) the thumping of Mr X's boots that disgusting sound when you keep shanking a zombie to make sure it stays down every sound just fits perfectly and sets the mood. Puzzles that are satisfying to solve. Those A ha! moments making a comeback. It also ties in perfectly with the next two things I like. Inventory management. None of those endless pockets here. You either have enough space discard another item or you backtrack here when you finally have room. Speaking of.. Smart backtracking. This is not traversing through empty space. There are key items that will be in the same room as you that can't be accessed. Not yet. There's plants and bullets you actually want to come back to and pick up and depending on your past actions may have to deal with some unpleasantries along the way. I actually had to plan how I'm gonna come back to certain areas. Mostly because of certain individual. Tyrant. I can most definitely say that even after getting spoiled by previews/gameplays before release having the knowledge that this guy can't be killed didn't make my encounters with this guy any less stressful. Someone should mod his AI so he can enter safe rooms. Replayability. Different modes to unlock. Story campaign long enough to not feel like a chore when replaying multiple times. Currently planning on how to pull off the 3 hour completion for that unlimited ammo. Didn't Like Writing. This is videogame storytelling from over 20 years ago. There is only so much a remake could do to modernize it without straying too far from the original. Still its not gonna blow anyone's mind. Also storywise some parts on the 2nd run playthrough just don't make any sense. Sections where you lose control of the main characters. Secondary character sections are meh at best frustrating at worst. Bosses. The 360 swipes the one shot kills the jump attacks.....come on guys. Evil Within 2 had more creative boss fights than this.

Better writing realistic facial expression and voice acting amazing visuals and a dismemberment system that STAR WARS games should be taking notes on. Normally I'd scoff at the loss of my tank controls (as I'm a master of the old titles) but the shift in control and perspective is superfluous when you take into consideration that Capcom managed to preserve the atmosphere and tone of the adventure without the need for the sense of dread that the fixed camera angles of the original imposed. Whether you're a veteran of the original or just a civilian reading about the horror in Raccoon City for the first time you owe it to yourself to play this game and experience the nightmare first hand.

I have to say one of the extra game modes should have translated to the main game it would have made it very challenging and instilled a lot of dread.,RESIDENT EVIL 2 / BIOHAZARD RE:2,1,

Any fan of video games should get this yes it's scary and can be uncomfortable but even so it's a blast to play. There's a lot of secrets in the RPD and easter eggs so it warrants several playthroughs.Considering how huge of a success this was I think we can count on Capcom remaking RE3. Here's to it being as good as this one.,RESIDENT EVIL 2 / BIOHAZARD RE:2,1,
3042,"2019-02-07",0,0,54,0,1,Resident Evil 2 Remake is a triumph of clever polished game design and is quite possibly our favourite game in the series. It leans into terrifying close encounters more than epic action setpieces but that s really what the series is about and RE2 does the terrifying perfectly. Enemies are superb and the game boasts the best zombies in any game ever unrelenting and mostly unstoppable they re just creepy. Then there s Mr X the game s own Jason Voorhees continuously stalking you throughout. We loved every moment of Resident Evil 2 and even if you know the first game inside out you won t know the Remake at all. If you ve ever loved a Resident Evil game or wished that RE7 was third person want to go back to RE2 and its great horror design or just want a horror action game get Resident Evil 2 Remake. You won t be disappointed.I don't regret a single cent well done devs.,RESIDENT EVIL 2 / BIOHAZARD RE:2,1,

3044,"2019-02-07",0,0,60,0,1,Short version of my review It was my wish that survival horror remained the same but if it had to change then this is the way to do it.9/10I feel like in the case of any remake the past experience of each individual with the original game plays a huge role in their opinion of the current iteration. RE is one of my favourite video game series and I have played all of the games extensively (yes even Gaiden). Like many others I consider the original RE2 the best of the bunch and while I enjoy RE4 and have played it more than 50 times on a variety of platforms I credit it with the downfall of RE and survival horror in general. I really liked RE7 for its return to horror themes and a more planned and tactical approach to combat but to me it never really matched the formula that makes a survival horror game which includes fixed camera angles and tank controls.Now comes the new RE2 and it took me by surprise when I saw it went TP over the shoulder. I was already disappointed I wanted a remake like the first and we were going to get a generic action game. How wrong I was.This game IS survival horror in the 21st Century. It is an amazing experience that brings back the tension of the old games and by that I mean the constant required planning of routes item carry and what to kill or ignore. I makes use of the well established setting and story and improves on it delivering more detail to the world and refining the gameplay to appeal to both newcomers and veterans alike. The new zombies are a less predictable and lickers are more deadly making your ability to aim a necessity rather than an overpowered mechanic. The new redesign of the RPD and the subsequent areas keeps things fresh but has many of the landmarks old fans will recognise especially in the beginning sections of the game. Some characters have their roles expanded like Chief Irons Marvin and Kendo but the story remains the same. Some enemies have been removed namely the spiders the crows and the moth while the G offspring was downgraded from boss to a powerful but numerous enemy. All the guns from the original make a return except for the Bow Gun but you won't really miss it. The gunplay is very satisfying and making your shots count is as important as ever just do yourself a favour and play on Hardcore. If there is something negative to say about this game is that the Devs probably rushed the A&amp B scenarios as they no longer complement each other making the experience rather repetitive. For instance aside from where you enter the RPD and the sequence of a couple of puzzles Leon A and Leon B are the same up until the end when you get an additional boss battle and the true ending cutscene. Leon no longer meets Claire in the RPD and they do not talk on the radio which I feel was a missed opportunity. I wanted to see more interactions between the main protagonists and a bit more character development but alas it does not really detract from the bulk of the experience. I wanted a traditional return to classic Survival Horror but instead got a modern masterpiece. This is Capcom's redemption and a rare time in which a Resident Evil fan can feel optimistic about the future. An absolute recommendation you owe it to yourself to play this game.,RESIDENT EVIL 2 / BIOHAZARD RE:2,1,
3045,"2019-02-07",0,0,13,0,1,Great game! I'm actually scared while playing it it feels just like when I used to turn on my PS2 and play resident evil when I was younger this is definitely a great remake I hope they remake RE4 like this but in order to do that they need to remake all of them .10/10 amazing,RESIDENT EVIL 2 / BIOHAZARD RE:2,1,
3046,"2019-02-07",0,0,49,0,1,Fantastic! Classic survival horror tension with a finely tuned modern control scheme. I was disappointed when I learned Capcom was doing away with the fixed camera angles of the original but it feels so good to play I forgave them almost instantly. The game would feel like a more complete package if the first and second run scenarios were true conterparts to each other rather than a different twist on the same events. However this is a relatively small issue in an otherwise fantastic reimagining of a twenty year old game. Capcom seems to be turning the franchise around after over a decade of bombastic (while still fun) action packed shooters and I'm elated to see them do it so successfully.,RESIDENT EVIL 2 / BIOHAZARD RE:2,1,
3047,"2019-01-26",0,0,70,0,1,This isn't just a remake this is a REimagining of what made the original game so special to those that played it back when it originally released and a welcoming experience for those new to RE2.Addendum Just buy the damn game it really is just incredible and I feel as though that doesn't do the game justice.,RESIDENT EVIL 2 / BIOHAZARD RE:2,1,
3048,"2019-02-08",0,0,18,0,1,this game made me wet and wide. im a man. thats how good it is.,RESIDENT EVIL 2 / BIOHAZARD RE:2,1,
3049,"2019-01-26",0,0,18,0,1,Classic survival horror returning with the RE engine. The game almost feels like a open world with the amount of replayability (ability to roam around) in the Raccoon City Police Department with the endless dark areas surrounding you for most of times during objectives gives the player a reminder of the hostiliy and how escaping one event doesn't neccesarily mean they won't be put in another. The game can be very punishing with the misuse of resources. Such as the attempt to guns blazing in to clearing a area will cause you to run out of ammo much faster than someone who would just use what is needed to bypass the enemies. This is because of the absurd hitpoints the enemies get making the player learn to be conservative with resources as possible. (Critical headshot in this game is rare)The visual design found in this remake will blow the old and newcomers into the Resident Evil series away. With the amount of detail found in the diliapidated Raccoon City to the terrifying facial designs of the zombies. (I also suggest users to switch to DirectX 12 if they encounter a bug with the first cutscene in the police station) The controls are something I can't talk about for keyboards since I just found it more simple with a controller. But the controller controls are fairly easy to remember. I'm expecting it to be the same thing as PS4 and Xbox. You should try and play around with the control settings such as toggle/hold for sprinting because it might not be the right one for you.The sound for this game will scare the living hell outta you. From the creaking floors in the police station to the endless footsteps created by Mr X trying to find you and last but not all the enemies growling sound all trying to make the player aim down their sight through every corridor and every hallway. Overall this is one hell of a game to remember in the franchise. Capcom being able to redesign a 90's game from the old tank control to a over shoulder camera angle to be able to appeal to modern day gamers show that they understand what survival horror fans today want and it is true that survival horror games do not get as much recognition as they should. But I think this one really does shine the light in the genre. I hope Resident Evil 3 Remake continues its development and nothing tragic happens in its way as I can't wait to discover what all the hype is about surrounding the 3rd series installment in its remake.,RESIDENT EVIL 2 / BIOHAZARD RE:2,1,

3053,"2019-02-06",0,0,15,0,1,Sound design is incredible! You never feel safe the ambient noise (coupled with Mr. X stomping around trying to kill you) creates such a spooky atmosphere. Graphically it's also very impressive and it actually runs really well. Gameplay is fun you're constantly low on supplies so you have to strategize your paths and figure out whether you even want to engage any of the zombies. Only thing I dislike is how some zombies can take like 10 shots to the head just to die while some take only a couple. So sometimes you'll waste your bullets since you assume it'll only take a few but in fact it takes many more. Maybe that's just me but in general it seems that the pistol is quite inconsistent in terms of damage compared to other weapons. That could be by design and I wouldn't be surprised as it's a survival horror but it's just something I noticed.Overall though it's great just a solid game without any nonsense.,RESIDENT EVIL 2 / BIOHAZARD RE:2,1,
3054,"2019-02-06",0,0,5,0,1,This game is totally FUNKY but Mr. X can be a pain in the neck sometimes... Still this game is very radical and I would advise you purchase it!,RESIDENT EVIL 2 / BIOHAZARD RE:2,1,
3055,"2019-02-06",0,0,32,0,1,Resident Evil 2 is how you do a remake. This is really how survival horror is supposed to feel like. Graphics are top notch sound design is on point and the game is just brimming with atmosphere. Not only that but there are two campaigns. You really get your money's worth with this game.,RESIDENT EVIL 2 / BIOHAZARD RE:2,1,
3056,"2019-02-05",0,0,34,0,1,Good game and I recommend buying it. But lets get to the negatives first so that Capcom hopefully does something about it with future updates Spoilers Ahead Story Zombie Brad is not in the game. Hopefully future updates add him back or if he isn't coming back on RE2 then hopefully Jill will face him as Zombie in RE3 Remake. Else it's going to be a waste. Ben's role in this Remake was a letdown. I was hoping to see more of him not just Leon being an and then Ben dying all of a sudden His death was cool but it was too quick . Leon didn't meet with Sherry on the police station at all. Even on Leon B. There's literally no connection between him and sherry in this game unlike RE2 and RE DSC. Even if he couldn't talk with her he should have seen her running away or something like that. Consistency error. If Willaim Birkin already breaks the bridge on the underground part of the police station when you play as Leon the bridge possibly couldn't be fixed in such a short time for Birkin to break it again when Claire comes. I'm not sure if Claire or Leon meets Birkin first but that is irrelevant since the bridge breaks on both campaigns which doesn't make sense. Same kind of error can be seen here and there in the game. There's barely any difference between A and B scenarios for the same character so at least there should have been consistencies among the story. Enemy types I didn't see different models of Lickers. Was expecting different Lickers on the lab. No spiders at all. Having at least few of them on the sewers would be great. Maybe just one spider as mini boss. Crows should have been at least present on cutscenes or something. Technical aspects Lack of proper support for different aspect ratios. Only 16 9 is supported properly. 21 9 works during gameplay but cutscenes are pillar boxed. 32 9 and multimonitor aspect ratios are vert vertically cropped . What's funny is that cutscenes are letter boxed to 16 9 and yet they are vertically cropped lol. 16 10 and 4 3 are letter boxed too.There should be options to turn off black bars and the cropping should be fixed. It's not like it's impossible cause all these problems are unofficially fixed and are available here on WSGF website www.wsgf.org . No option to turn off vignette. It makes the game way too dark. Again it is fixed by fans See the link on WSGF above . Having the ability to turn it off would be great. Ingame contrast slider would be great too. This game has sharpening filter which works well with TAA but any Anti Aliasing setting other than TAA suffers from severe sharpening which looks downright ugly. An option to disable sharpening filter would be great so that SMAA and FXAA can be used. Interlaced mode on PC looks noticeably worse than Xbox One X's interlaced mode as you can see on Leon's hair which shimmers weirdly on PC with interlaced mode with TAA. A small fix on this issue would be appreciated.These are some of the few things which if fixed would make the game a GOTY material for me. The game in it's current state is already great and was totally worth the 60$. The base game is long enough and enjoyable to justify the 60$.I finally found another good third person game on PC after Evil Within 2. There are so many 3rd person single player games on consoles and I like 3rd person games. The gore in this game is on point too. Shooting zombies and seeing visual feedback really adds to the immersion.,RESIDENT EVIL 2 / BIOHAZARD RE:2,1,

It really fixes what not only what the original Resident Evil 2 could have done better through but also what the Resident Evil Remake and Resident Evil 7 Biohazard could have done better through.

3073,"2019-02-08",0,0,29,0,1,In spite of its success it's clear RE7 was a mere test run for this game and oh boy what a gem this is. RE RE2 is a faithful but altered version of the original classic with a refined formula from RE7.Leon is good but is arguably the weakest of the characters here as Claire wins the badass big sister trophy. Marvin for how little we get to see of him is fantastically played. The experienced cop knowing that his time is basically up but still willing to bare the pain to give the rookie/ unfortunate Claire the chance they need to live. Ada is the sassy spy we all know and love and she steals Leon's spotlight once they link up. Their flirting is however adorable.Gameplay and performance is TIGHT. While my GTX 1070 is not a good benchmark for budget builds playing on near max had 0 frame drops. Interfaces work well on PC with good mouse control. Capcom has done an incredible job. Zombies are tough but responsive to your attacks riding a line between fodder and sponge that makes them surprisingly dangerous in groups and worth planning around. Lickers make their terrifying return in their most aggressive and nerve racking form yet depending on how you engage them. Add in a couple new creatures and you're in for a good ol spookin. Your first play through is probably going to be rough being low on reserves but probably not reaching hopelessness. Get to grips with the game and how to properly react/prepare for it and it can be a cake walk and a perfect route into the game's time based rating system and of course the challenging S+ rank.My only complaints 1. breakable knives (though I know why its designed that way) and 2.

3093,"2019-02-02",0,0,44,0,1,"When Resident evil 2 was originally released it truly brought terror to a whole new level. Overtime Resident Evil wasn't truly living up to it's horror aspect as the game progressed further and further into a more action like film rather than a survival horror video game where we feared for the worst in the safe room when there was no ammo or herbs. This Remake is a ""breath of fresh air"" to those that are seeking for something the classic Resident Evil titles provided back then the nostalgia when I played this was such a trip. Thank you Capcom for starting this year off right! (For fans that want the full experience I suggest starting on ""Hardcore"" difficulty!)",RESIDENT EVIL 2 / BIOHAZARD RE:2,1,
3094,"2019-02-04",0,0,111,0,1,Product received for free. Many were shocked when Capcom requested the discontinuation of a Resident Evil 2 fan remake but even more surprising was the company's announcement that they would be working on a remake of the 1998 original. Resident Evil 2 is often considered the pinnacle of the franchise but even though it made a number of improvements to the series' gameplay it never managed to be a scary survival horror game. Out with the bad stuff and welcome to the new fancy featuresSo this time around Capcom has fused the best of old school and modern survival horror elements together into one amazing game that clearly stands as the best the series has to offer. The first thing you'll probably notice about the new Resident Evil 2 is that the gameplay has changed in favour for a middle ground of both immersion and improvement of character control. Many of the issues associated with the tanklike character movement are no longer the case and the fixed camera angles have been thrown out of the window for delivering an over the shoulder camera which brings the horror close up especially when the undead are are about to bite your neck. The gameplay isn't just the same old thing. A number of new twists have been added to Resident Evil 2 such as the defense items which add quite a bit of strategy to the game. Knowing when to use a defense item can often mean the difference between life and death and it adds a welcome layer of complexity to the game's combat.. At the game's outset you choose from one of two characters to play as everyones favourite first day on the job rookie policeman Leon S. Kennedy and Chris Redfield's sister Claire each of whom has his or her own set of weaponry. For example Claire can use a grenade launcher that will either shoot acid or flame rounds towards your enemies while Leon can thin out the horde of enemies with a shotgun. Another addition to the gameplay is the enhanced A. I. of the Tyrant (T 103 Model) or better known as Mr. X . Unlike the original this time he can follow your almost anywhere even into the infamous R.P.D. main hall which used to be a safe area.A feast for everyoneWhen Capcom stated that even veterans have to relearn certain things like puzzles or item locations for the remake they weren t kidding. Enemies items and events have been switched around so that the game will seem completely changed to all but those who beat the original a number of times or have recently played it. Many of the high stress areas from the original game have been completely reworked which can create a real sense of suspense or relief such as when the Licker you're expecting to appear in a certain corridor doesn't actually show up. While some of the puzzles are new and others have been slightly altered many have not. You'll still be collecting a multitude of keys plugs and all other sorts of junk while trying to make sense of where they might be used in the environment. This amounts to a great deal of backtracking throughout the game and there will also be many times when you'll be moving forward into new territory only to realize that you need to return to an item box to get the item you need to move forward. By now you've likely realized that Resident Evil 2 is one fine looking game but screenshots and video clips can't begin to do the game justice. Capcom has finally perfected the art of utilizing their proprietary RE Engine and the result is the most visually impressive video game ever released. The attention to detail is exceptional. Of particular note is the gore it is by far the most graphically realistic gore ever included in a game. Blood will gush from bodies and somehow realistically splatter and when large amounts of the red stuff hit your character you re soaked in that red liquid. Taking off a zombie's head with the shotgun rewards you with an explosion of particle effects that simply has to be seen to be appreciated. Despite all this the game's graphics do have a few shortcomings such as in the some weird reflections on shiny materials or 16 9 cutscenes which require a fix via modding. But this is just nitpicking an otherwise unmatched visual experience.Voice acting was a noticeably weak aspect of the original version of Resident Evil 2 but with with the new voice actors this is no longer the case. This time the voice acting is one of the best parts of the game and that praise isn t only limited to Nick Apostolides and Stephanie Panisello voice performances this praise applies to the entire ensemble of the voice actors in this game.TL DR With two playable main characters four (slightly) different scenarios almost a dozen different tofu survivors a 4th survivor mode and an upcoming free DLC including Robert Kendo Katherine Warren and an unknown soldier the game also offers you plenty to do. With the exception of some unrealistic constraints e. g. you can t shoot locks and knobs to open a wooden door Capcom has nearly perfected its craft and created the best Resident Evil ever.,RESIDENT EVIL 2 / BIOHAZARD RE:2,1,

3107,"2019-02-08",0,0,24,0,1,To be honest Capcom did a great job on this remake. It's not some HD remastered thing. And instead of making it same as RE2 1998 it got some new puzzle and riddle. So it is useless if you know all the playthrough of RE2 1998. And ammo and resource are low so even if you can aim better and move faster than '98 this game is balanced.But if you ask me if this game is perfect I'd say those boss fight are little bit easy and the plot between Claire and Leon are less than RE2 '98.

3124,"2019-01-31",0,0,10,0,1,Resident Evil is a series that passed me by when I was a kid and the series was at its peak. I played one of the early games back in the day but never finished it because I struggled with the controls and camera. I decided to try out Resident Evil 2 because I saw a playthrough on YouTube and I m glad I did.The game has received a massive Graphical overhaul and although it stays true to the original game there is a whole new section and monster to deal with whilst the tension and atmosphere feel fresh. I ve never played a game with such a sense of hopelessness before as my resources dwindle.You can play through RE2 with either Leon or Claire and whilst both playthroughs will take place in the same setting there are differences to each. It s well worth playing through both possibly multiple times. Zombies are very well done in RE2 as are the rest of the monster roster with varying degrees of difficulty and ways of bringing them down. The quiet moments of the game get your heart pounding as you edge your way through the darkness. The narrative is well done and whilst it maintains some of the cheesiness of the originals it feels very up to date in this remake.RE2 look stunning. The dark areas are proper dark and the map is filled with detail. The animations are fluid and believable and the map in general just feels believable. The puzzles are meaningful and the added stress of worrying about the resident ghoulies really sees you making some funny errors even in the simplest of tasks. The 3rd person camera feels great and the character models nicely detailed. Performance wise RE2 never put a foot wrong.Playthrough on the normal difficulty took me between 7 and 8 hours for each character and I definitely see replay value as I am sure I ll be playing through again. Capcom show here how a remake should be done and I hope they give some of their other games similar treatment.,RESIDENT EVIL 2 / BIOHAZARD RE:2,1,

3130,"2019-02-09",0,0,19,0,1,Resident Evil 2 is not only one of (if the the) best remakes of a classic that I've ever played it's one of the best playing games I've dug into in a long time. I was thrilled to come to the RE2 remake after playing so much of the original on PS1. I will say that it's not a shot for shot re release of the original but I think everything that has changed has been great.I hadn't played an RE game since possibly RE4 or so but this game feels like everything I was looking for in a new survival horror game. Every single gameplay element has been thoughtfully designed with a lot of strategy in mind but also immersive gameplay. The amount of cinematic experiences you get from not having ammo in a certain part and have to make a big risk to get somewhere make for some great stories to share with friends.I think one of the biggest changes with a certain villain chasing you around more frequently than expected make for a more interesting gameplay experience. Hiding in a room and hearing a THUMP THUMP THUMP down the hall pressures you into trying to figure out the best paths to take and best ways to avoid danger. I don't think that change really gets in the way of major puzzle solving and shows up just enough to scare the daylights out of you to great effect.The graphics and performance are phenomenal. There's so many options for tuning that the game should run on just about any system and it looks amazing. I haven't played a game in a long time that cut seamlessly to a cutscene and everything looked like a pre rendered movie. It was jaw dropping a lot of the time.If you're a die hard fan of the original you're going to absolutely love this game. The great thing about this RE2 though is that you can enjoy it just as much even if you've never touched a game in the series previously.Really can't recommend this one enough!,RESIDENT EVIL 2 / BIOHAZARD RE:2,1,

3156,"2019-01-31",0,0,29,0,1,"Awesome remake of an awesome game brought almost perfectly to 2019. My only complain is more ""after the fact"" and in no way (for me at least) big enough of a reason to not buy the game so it will be in spoilers. Unlike the original game where you played with one character first and then saw the point of view of the other character the first run affected the second. For example you could use an item to close the window shutters on a hallway on your first run and if you did that zombies wouldnt burst through the windows in that run but they would on your second run. Some damage to areas from the first run were visible on the second run or rooms that needed you to do certain things on both runs to be accesible on the second one.Here both runs are independent almost to a story breaking degree because you pick up almost the same items from mostly the same place on both stories except some key items. Some situations happen exactly the same or characters die in both scenarios in different ways or you kill the same enemy in the same form in both scenarios while in the original you fought in one scenario one form and in the other scenario the next mutation and so on.I would like to see this problem fix but realistically it wont since it would mean almost remaking the second run/scenario. Still absolutly recomended to buy even if you havent played the original or any other game in the franchise since the story is suficiently contained as to not miss much.",RESIDENT EVIL 2 / BIOHAZARD RE:2,1,

Inventory management scarce resources hard to kill zombies epic boss fights phenomenal music and much more is returning with the classic 3rd person over the shoulder we've all come to enjoy in RE4.I can honestly say that going through the RPD police station while hearing the footsteps of Mr. X was downright terrifying. It was simply an amazing experience and i highly recommend this game for anyone to play. No doubt there are already so many positive reviews of this game out there so i don't need to say much more.Ps. I recommend you play this game on hardcore. Treat this like you would Dark Souls.

3164,"2019-02-09",0,0,48,0,1,Best Resident Evil yet? Pretty much. Resident Evil 2 (2019) is a remake of that much beloved original RE2 and in this case it improves pretty much every aspect from the astounding almost photo realistic graphics to the immersive atmosphere and sound design to the methodical combat and to the rafters production values. This screams polish and the love for the game and story is obvious. There's none of the terrible voice acting but the odd cheezy line are nice callbacks. Zombies are no longer basic fodder but a true and dangerous threat from the start of the game to the nail biting finish. RE2 is survival horror perfected for a new generation of desensitized gamers and the previous generation of nostalgic STARS members who are ready to see what they remember as awesome being blown out of the water by this work of interactive horror. Are there flaws? In some parts the oppressive darkness of the environments (which is probably intended) could have been slightly less for convenience's sake. The seeming immortal basic zombies can frustrate after you pour a dozen headshots into one and it still comes at you but that is once again probably intended and something you'll eventually accept.Not for the squeamish as it surely rivals Mortal Kombat with the gore and blood. But if you like survival horror this is the real deal. If you love the Resident Evil series you've already bought this. Capcom you did right this time. Now where's Resident Evil 3 Remake? 10 of 10.

Make them do more damage and find less ammo? Not the end of the world.Id wish I seen a shove or kick zombies out of the way feature maybe a curb stomp when you knock them down?Counter attacks A+ given if you have the items on you.Adding gun powder to make ammo very nice makes getting ammo for whatever gun easier.The cut scenes with Clair in them hahaha wtf the faces she makes for how shes rendered in the game its funny for how bad she looks.The auto discard of items would be nice to have again.Adding a +1 to guns that are mag fed would but a nice thing to see also.",RESIDENT EVIL 2 / BIOHAZARD RE:2,1,

I dont know how well it does compared to the original but I strongly recommend this game for anyone slightly interessted in Resident Evil and or those (like me) who allways wanted to play through a horror game in full and never accomplished it.There seem to be 2 Stories in the game 1st Leons Story and 2nd Claires Story.

3180,"2019-02-10",0,0,62,0,1,Absolutely incredible. As a long time fan of the Resident Evil series RE2 has always been in my top 5 games of all time. I was sceptical as to whether Capcom could pull of a remake of RE2 that felt both fresh but also didn't change too much of what made the original great. But boy did they do it with this! I think this may even be better than the original RE2 which I can't believe I am saying. It is genuinely terrifying. Being stalked by Mr X is what nightmares are made of. The zombies that shuffle around in the dark and lunge for you when you least expect it and not to mention the visually pleasing combat system which literally sees the zombies bodies fall to pieces in front of your very eyes when you unload bullets into them.Dialogue is also much improved and it also has a great deal of replayability to it.

(actually 2 one as Leon and one as Claire where you can play a third version as a slightly different outcoming) I have yet to play the second storyline (Claire) so I have to find out yet what this brings. And for the third story I must be honest that I don't feel thrilled about it to play it since it only differs a bit from the original one.Overal I should give this game a 8/10 rating for the fun I had.I defenitly recommend this game but keep the short story in mind when buying.

3224,"2019-02-09",0,0,12,0,1,Great game scary and immersive. This came to me by surprise so I wanted to write a review to offer a serious word to the wise CONSERVE YOUR AMMO. I got pretty decently far into the game and completely ran out dry because I was too careless it became unplayable and impossible to continue forcing me to start over. I've heard of players running out of ammo on the last boss fight too making it so they cannot beat the game.Zombies usually take A LOT of hits in the head to fully be killed so try your absolute best to run past them/avoid them when you get the opportunity. Otherwise try not to miss and obviously aim for the head. They also will get back up 90% of the time even when you think they're dead so be on your toes. Truly put yourself in the mindset that every bullet costs a million dollars.Also save a lot without overwriting the same file. Create multiple saves as you go on so if you accidentally find yourself in a pinch like I did you can always go back without starting everything over.,RESIDENT EVIL 2 / BIOHAZARD RE:2,1,
3225,"2019-02-09",0,0,10,0,1,"Hey Capcom I don't often take the time to post reviews but this game warrants one. You guys knocked it out of the park with this remake. This is exactly what we older gamers had hoped for and were afraid you might fall short of. It appears our fears were unfounded. Well Done. It is obvious that your team took great pains to stay true to the source material and bring it into the 21st century. RE2 Remake evokes the same fear and excitement as the original and it runs just beautifully! Thank you for all of the options to tweak graphical quality and game performance. Having these options means that I can easily recommend the game to people with all kinds of PCs knowing that they can fine tune their experience to an enjoyable point even if their computer isn't the newest/strongest/most expensive. This is a point that a lot of Triple A PC Game Developers forget about and I applaud you for it. If you remember playing the original 20 years ago you will not be disappointed in this version.If you never had the chance to experience Resident Evil 2 before I highly recommend you play this version. Though I did not pay $60 for my copy (I got the game for $45 pre release) I do agree that it's a fair price. The negatives I'm a little bit incensed that I have to buy DLC to hear the original announcer say ""RESIDENT EVIL.......TWOoooo"" on the splash screen. But in this day of rampant microtransactions designed to leech money from the consumer baked into nearly every new Triple A game I can let this one point slide. At some point I'll buy it just to experience that nostalgia But not today. Final verdict 10/10",RESIDENT EVIL 2 / BIOHAZARD RE:2,1,

It makes my hair stand hearing zombies growls and Lickers snarls echoing in the hallways.Second Tough Zombies. Just when you thought they're down for the count as you pass by them they'll grab your feet upward to bite your neck. That gets me a lot jumping off my chair. You don't need to put them down permanently.Third Agile Lickers. RE 2 Remake Lickers are the most terrifying Lickers I have ever faced. RE OPRC and RE 5 Lickers are nothing compared to this Lickers.Fourth Tyrant or Mr. X. He will find you where ever you are in the police station. That adds up to the horror when you hear his stomping getting louder and louder.Fifth Item Management. Your storage is really limited.

3231,"2019-02-09",0,0,15,0,1,I can not get over how I absolutely love this game. It combines the resource scarcity of Resident Evil 7 with the gameplay of Resident Evil 4 and the horror of what makes a great Resident Evil game. In other words this game is a masterclass of Resident Evil which I never thought I'd ever get to experience after something as amazing as Resident Evil 4 was made. It's like hearing that a Star Wars sequel was actual better than the originals. The only complaint I have is that the way you have to solve puzzles is a bit confusing at first because I didn't realize that you have to read every piece of paper you find in order to progress (whereas I'm used to them containing optional expositional information).If you want a great review I highly recommend AngryJoe's Youtube review I can't sum it up any better than that,RESIDENT EVIL 2 / BIOHAZARD RE:2,1,
3232,"2019-02-09",0,0,34,0,1,I am a fan of resident evil series and I've played original resident evil 2. It's not resident evil 0 remake with better graphic but everything the same. If you played original resident evil 2 before you know you need to solve puzzle in the monster crowded police station. I'm struggle for the ammo shortage in the first run but it's not very difficult if you know the position of items and dangerous enemies. The only drawback is that the 2nd game play is kind of tedious. Finishing Leon/Claire story lines is good enough. The only thing different is the position of important items and puzzles.

3242,"2019-02-08",0,0,16,0,1,An incredible update to a classic survival horror game. I typically go into new games in a loved series very skeptically (especially remakes) but this game genuinely surprised me. I was worried they would dumb it down or change too much for the worse but they didn't do any of that. I honestly think this game is on par with the first game's REmake it just got so much right.If you're upset that it's not fixed camera angles and tank controls you're sorely missing out. It only benefits from all the updates it makes to the original game and the control style is enjoyable without ruining the atmosphere. Also don't worry it's not a goofy action game like RE5 or RE6 was the tension and horror of the original Resident Evil 2 is there alive and kicking and amplified by the huge leap in graphical quality.The difficulties available in the game range from easy to hardcore mode (which classic players will enjoy) making it perfect for new or old fans of the series.If nothing else will convince you just know Mr. X in the original game was annoying... Mr. X in this game will make you your pants.,RESIDENT EVIL 2 / BIOHAZARD RE:2,1,

3251,"2019-02-08",0,0,52,0,1,Honestly I have never played a Resident Evil game before this one and Resident Evil 7. I have always heard high praise from the Resident Evil games before 5 and 6 which I could not understand because I had never played them. But from game standards this game is a 10/10 for me. The pure nostalgia I felt when i entered the police station was beautiful. The fact that I feel anything like that while still not having played the original is wonderous to me and amazing that they could pull it off. Graphics wise this game is fantastic I've never seen something like the RE Engine and It should be the standard graphics of all video games in the future. Gameplay wise I was immersed as . I have seen so many people complaining about how hard the game is from the few amount of resources at your disposal the strength of the zombies and how long it takes to kill them and to Mr. X chasing you every 10 seconds and to those arguments I say shut the up. All of those arguments point out how perfect and amazing this game really is. Why would anyone want a laid back no fun survival horror game where you could steam roll through the whole game with no challenges. Challenges are what make you strive to beat the game in the first place and they make you feel all the more accomplished when you finally beat the game or get an achievement or beat your record time or get an S+ ranking on one of your runs. All of these accomplishments in the game just really feel... great. I personally never have the feeling of wanting to 100% a video game because either the game doesn't have that lasting effect I need or the games achievements and goals are too plain and have no sort of unlockable item or addition to the game if you do them. But Resident Evil 2 has some of the best goal driven gameplay I have ever played. This had been the only game I have ever wanted to 100% in my life and I will strive to do that until I complete this task. Overall this might be the best game I have ever bought on Steam ever. 10/10 Would Recommend,RESIDENT EVIL 2 / BIOHAZARD RE:2,1,

I haven't been excited about a game for too long probably since S.O.M.A. This game reminds me that you don't need a game that does everything for the gamer. I particularly like to be challenged in a game specially in this horror survival genre and this title achieves that.I highly recommend this title.,RESIDENT EVIL 2 / BIOHAZARD RE:2,1,
3266,"2019-02-10",0,0,21,0,1,I don't buy games before release anymore but this is one of few games I would throw money at the second I could. It blends the old Resident Evil with the new flawlessly to recreate what older survival horror captured while maintaining it's own identity. Runs fine too on my Frankenstein PC no real issues I've seen since launch. Sometimes I drop frames but it's only when I'm moving faster than the game can load or there's a lot of going on in one space.The RE Engine has never looked better. There is plenty of attention to detail if you look for it. Most of the zombies feel unique and present a real threat on top of classic enemies making a return. Mr X is one scary Lickers will literally rip you a new one if you don't deal with them etc.It's only short comings I can think of is that after you do everything there's not much left to keep your attention. Capcom however is releasing DLC for the game and it's all free. FREE. Who doesn't like free things? ...Also Claire's model looks kinda' and she comes as off dumb and ignorant about everything....Also I don't remember Leon having a butt chin. What's up with that?In short I'd recommend everyone (fan or not) to pick this up even if they're not into horror games. It does a little bit of everything without being master of none.,RESIDENT EVIL 2 / BIOHAZARD RE:2,1,

From jumpscares from not wanting to die.Decent replay value with 2 (technically 4) main different stories. I'd say the first story takes about 6 8 hours but subsequent playthroughs can be shortened down to 3 5 (due to familiarity of the game and reduced spook factor). A few extra game modes that'll tide you over for an extra few hours. So 10 14 (16 24 if you play all 4 stories) on average.Just a great game.,RESIDENT EVIL 2 / BIOHAZARD RE:2,1,

This is a true survival horror game in every sense of the word After you complete the game you feel genuinely lucky to be alive at all. The game doesn't give you much of anything so you have to be really careful how you manage your inventory.,RESIDENT EVIL 2 / BIOHAZARD RE:2,1,
3282,"2019-01-28",0,0,12,0,1,Survival Horror RebornWhen I heard that Resident Evil 2 was getting a remake of sorts I could genuinely say I was excited. Resident Evil 7 brought back everything that made Resident Evil well Resident Evil. Skrimping by on supplies and managing your inventory was definately what made the game so challenging in its hay day. And now here we are with the remake and what can I say that everyone hasn't said already? Nothing. So lets get into the nitty gritty.A Beautifully Grim ApocolypseLike Resident Evil 7 Resident Evil 2 takes advantage of the RE Engine a powerhouse that delivers a truly gourgeous retelling of enviroments and set pieces from the original and it doesn't stop just there. Character models Props Weapons and Monsters are all modeled with incredible detail from blood sticking to your clothes through to how you can individually tear chunks of flesh from zombies. The more open outside segments do deliver with great lighting effects and reflections from rain and street lights and textures on the police station are crisp and highly detailed. A Hero and Heroine RisesLike the original you can take on the roles of Leon Kennedy and Claire Redfield two survivors caught in the middle of a zombie outbreak. Both characters have a unique personality and of course a unique playthrough that varies greatly between their weapons and key characters they meet from Sherry Birkin and Ada Wong. They aren't silent either both characters will exclaim their current prediciment and even display pained emotions when injured. A Looming ThreatAs in the original you will encounter familiar enemies and key monsters and one in particular will literally keep you on your toes. The Tyrant T 00 (Mr. X) returns but this time around he's a little different. The Tyrant is a continuous threat that looms over you throughout certain parts of the game and conventional means prove to be useless against him so your best course of action is to simply run since shooting him with even your more powerful weapons prove to just put him out of commission momentarily only for him to come back in full force.My Criticism's and Addressing OthersIf you're expecting to come into this game with the mind set that it will be easy you're surely wrong. Yes. This game is difficult even on the Standard difficulty setting which to me isn't much of an issue. But I do find mild irritation with some things. Yes this is a survival game and yes you're expected to manage your resources since spending ammo to kill certain enemies is pointless and more often then not you can just run past enemies without wasting a single bullet. But sometimes you're going to have to pop a shot off on some enemies and in the original zombies weren't all that difficult to take down especially with a shotgun. Sometimes in the original you could just stand still aim high with a shotgun and blow a zombies head clean off without any fuss. In the remake however the zombies are far more resiliant to even basic gunfire and unlike how in the original a few shots from your pistol could take down the most weakest of opponents in this game zombies can soak up rounds better than Hannibal Buress. Why does 6 critical shots to the head simply stun the zombie? Why does a point range shotgun blast to the face do diddly squat? I understand that the devs wanted the player to simply immobilize zombies so you can more easily traverse the station but even that feels pointless. A new feature to the game which I do find useful is the addition of barricades but even when a window has been barricaded you will always return to that area with a handful of zombies still wandering about. With how much I enjoy the return of The Tyrant he becomes more of a nuisnace then a threat. Yes. I still shake in my chair when I hear his thunderous footsteps but after that I get a mix of fear and frustration since trying to ourtun him only leads you into more danger forcing you to rush certain tasks which again I understand for the sake of keeping suspense at an all time high.Some people have complained about the difficulty. And to that I say play assisted mode then. It pretty much holds your hand and raises your chances of survival. And if its still too hard? Then go back to Fortnite and Minecraft. My Vinal VerdictEven with the antiquated controls and mild nuisances Resident Evil 2 is effectively reborn. It has plenty of new twists for seasoned players and is very friendly to new comers and with that in mind it casts a bright light showing that 2019 is off to a great start and that survival horror is still very much alive.My Score 8.5/10,RESIDENT EVIL 2 / BIOHAZARD RE:2,1,

3319,"2019-02-12",0,0,10,0,1,I'll admit at first I was skeptical as well anyone would be when a company decides to remake one of their classics. However everything about this game is flawless. Capcom set the bar for what a remake should be so high every remake from now on will be measured against this game. The magic of the original was perfectly captured while modernizing it. It's like this is what they wanted the original game to be all along. There are people who will complain about Mr.X being too hard or the game being unfair do not listen to them. This isn't Call of Duty this is Resident Evil. It is Survival Horror you are supposed to always be low on supplies and it comes down to management and skill.Exploring the environment is as much of a puzzle as the actual puzzles do you clear this hallway or do you leave the enemies alive? If I kill this enemy will it alert Mr. X? Everything in this game needs to be taken in to account and your moves must be calculated. It requires as much bold strategy as it does careful maneuvering.Once you get the hang of the controls and have a decent grasp on the map subsequent runs will come easier on both A and B scenarios. I'd suggest writing down answers to puzzles and combinations to lockers and safes as they are different on A and B runs.Resident Evil 2 is exactly what a remake should be it is a phenomenal game that everyone should play.,RESIDENT EVIL 2 / BIOHAZARD RE:2,1,

The graphics are amazing &amp the controls feel right. The game took me about 15 hours to complete both Leon and Claire's first run but there are second runs for each character that vary quite a bit from the first as well. If anyone is wondering if this game is actually scary or not don't worry because it truly is (I'd compare it to RE7 in terms of scariness).

3325,"2019-02-12",0,0,16,0,1,"Holy hot damn is it good. For me RE2 REmake sets the franchise right back on track. Now where do i sign up for the RE3 Nemesis treatment?I had my doubts when this remake on Resident Evil 2 was first announced. Would Capcom be able to capture the spirit of the good ol' original? RE2 is a fanfavorite (rightly so even though I prefer RE3 myself) and even the slightest deviation from the original could mean swarms of angry fans with torches and pitchforks. Was RE2 really the best choice for a remake? Why didnt they cast the original voice actors?! Will a 3rd person camera do justice that what RE2 did back then? Will it still have partner zapping or will capcom just settle for a co op campaign and call it a day? So i had my doubts but it's finally here and i'm glad to say that it was well worth the wait. The previously released RE7 (yes confusing for newcomers i admit) was really good at times (The mansion! The greenhouse!) but it could get pretty bland at times too (SAW traps boring caves etc). So RE7 was a step in the right direction and the engine behind the game had loads of potential. Now RE2 grabs that promising engine and handles that missed potential way better!! Instead of the rather slow introduction SAW elements and lineair caves from RE7 RE2 brings back a true Resident Evil game making it an engaging game from start to finish. When playing RE2 remake these were just a few thoughts I had ""But I shouldn't waste the little supplies i have... Which routes should i take to evade them and what are the best angles?""""I should save that Flashgrenade for later""""Is it fight or flight?""""What?? Hold on a minute lemme check the map""""I see i'll probably need this item later then""""Dont mind me Mr zombie just keep doing whatever you were doing ok? To me you're invisible enough ok? hahaah? (awkwardly looks both ways then continues the attempt to creep/dodge)""""Gotta check out that room. But i'm not sure how or if it's even worth the risk""""Uuhhhmm that sound... Is that what i think it is...?! Now i can't see it right away but THAT sounds like BIG TROUBLE"". The game is very tense and in all the right ways. So in my opnion this is how a great (horror) game is done!!***This review will be updated as I myself only completed Leon's story first now which took me like 15 hours. But there's more good stuff waiting in the 2nd half of the story in which you play as Claire's perspective. You can also begin the story as Claire and finish the second half with Leon so that brings the game to a total of 4 playthroughs. And then you can play on higher difficulty too so theres plenty to go around of you ask me!!!",RESIDENT EVIL 2 / BIOHAZARD RE:2,1,

As a huge fan of the original Resident Evil games playing them with friends huddled in front of whichever console during a sleepover I have to say that this is the game truest to those roots to be released post RE4. It still feels fresh for being a remake not relying too much on your nostalgia but still a remake all the same. This is the Resident Evil game I've been waiting for since playing the first few and the game I've been hoping for since playing the REmake back on GameCube. I'm hoping they can keep this going and we can all forget about punching boulders.,RESIDENT EVIL 2 / BIOHAZARD RE:2,1,
3335,"2019-02-04",0,0,44,0,1,Not without it's faults but still an amazing experience. My biggest nitpicks Scenario's A &amp B were too similar if you've played the original you know what I mean. You don't even meet Mr. X until Scenario B in the original. Which just made everything much more different and interesting. This one felt repetitive though I've still played through both Scenarios several times.They cut out many of Leon and Claire's interactions with each other (Ex Walkie Talkie scenes Meeting at S.T.A.R.S office Claire asking Leon about Sherry Leon having to pick up Sherry towards the end and more!). Who else thought those scenes were pretty important to the development of the main characters? In the end it felt like they actually grew together and bonded through their ordeal. The remake not so much.Mr.X was actually pretty fun and made for some tense moments.The part with The giant Alligator seemed rushed.Last but not least the lack of music. I didn't really think anything of it at first until I got the Soundtrack Swap DLC and it's been a game changer. Everything just feels so right it's the only way to play the remake. If you've already beaten the game several times and want to try something new look up the 1st person mod. It's great Capcom should have made this an extra mode after beating the game on S or something. Also I wish they would have included an Extreme Battle mode like in the Ps1 Dual Shock version which is similar to Mercenaries or Raid mode from the other RE games. Would have given this game even more replay value. Maybe they could make that a future DLC? I'd buy it. Luckily I hear we're getting a Free DLC soon....By the way Great job by Capcom optimizing this game. Runs pretty decent on my 7 year old laptop without having to lower everything. Here's hoping for Resident Evil 3!,RESIDENT EVIL 2 / BIOHAZARD RE:2,1,

3341,"2019-02-12",0,0,45,0,1,Ok so This is how a remake is suposed to be done.I did not play original RE2 but I was couch watching my cousin play it.Why is this a great model for remake?First + Grafics that are nobrainer that is what makes a remake/remaster in the first place.Second + a Frigin proper setting screen. You dont offten see a performance load meter or so many relevant options with actual examples and that should be in every game that is not 2D or pixel art style. Third + they mixed up enemy locations and item locations at least a fair bit. Also they added some more stuff so that is what gives a remake a value.Fourth + playability and other features that have to be in a very good game done.The only two minuses that I found and had are.First glitchfesting speedrunners. Simply I do not consider a glitch skip or something similar as a speedrun cause lot of reasons but this is preferential. Srsly skipping half of game thru invisible gliding is just bull****.Second Hitbox bugs no so offten seen but they are half responsible for glitchrunners and some anoying sytuations that happen only 1 in 100 times in regular run.,RESIDENT EVIL 2 / BIOHAZARD RE:2,1,
3342,"2019-02-12",0,0,35,0,1,This is how remakes should be done. Controls are also nice tight responsive and laid out perfectly.,RESIDENT EVIL 2 / BIOHAZARD RE:2,1,
3343,"2019-02-12",0,0,55,0,1,"9/10This RE2 remake is the proof that remakes/reboots can be amazing when done right. This shows that Capcom despite still messing up here and there throughout the years is still listening to their fans and willing to fix their past mistakes by creating content that people actually want.RE2 feels as welcoming to new players as it also feels refreshing to fans from the original games.Rather than continue to go down the path of games like RE6 this game goes back to the origins of the Resident Evil games gruesome disturbing horror. There are no cover mechanics no dodge abilities and no melee combat other than attacking with a knife. You rely entirely on aiming and running except this time using a third person view instead of the classic ""tank controls"" which not only allows the player to get a closer look at the disturbing enemies coming their way but also to aim where they want to aim (rather than a fixed up/center/down aim from the original game).The game looks and feels amazing a whole new look at the classic scenarios like the police station the sewers and the laboratory with nothing held back in terms of gore and violence. The game still feels like the classic game as it maintains many of the original items and even the layout for some of the places but also making some very necessary changes by either adding things that were needed or removing things that weren't. The layout of the police station is slightly different but a lot of it is still like the original. As an example Claire's crossbow was removed since it was an awful weapon to use in the original game being replaced with the SMG (which is no longer a special weapon) and the grenade launcher now only uses incendiary and acid rounds with no ""normal rounds"" anymore. Weapon upgrades can be found for almost every weapon in the game instead of only for Leon's arsenal. Puzzles were reworked to feel less annoying and troublesome while still offering some challenge and the inventory while still quite limited can now be upgraded by finding hip pouches.One interesting detail the game adds is that there are no more ""safe doors"" as enemies will chase the character through doors. Mr. X also shows up in both scenarios further increase how tense the game feels as he'll be relentlessly chasing the character until they manage to run away or temporarily stun him with headshots. He remains present through a good portion of the game and can be heard patrolling around requiring caution in order to avoid the areas he's patrolling.Difficulty levels are quite balanced Normal offers a decent challenge without feeling overwhelming Easy has enemies somewhat weakened and offers aim assist and Hardcore is pretty much a harder version of the original game the game can only be saved by using ink ribbons plus enemies are harder. In addition there are also less hip pouches to be found and some of the health/ammo items are replaced with ink ribbons.There is also a good number of unlockables. 4th Survivor is unlocked by beating both scenarios while Tofu Survivor is unlocked by beating 4th Survivor. There are also 5 infinite weapons that can be unlocked by achieving certain rankings in certain difficulties as well. S rank now only requires the game to be beaten under a certain time limit (according to difficulty and scenario) while S+ rank requires that plus a maximum number of 3 saves and no use of infinite weapons.My only problem with the game is that scenarios A and B don't really feel that different. While in the classic game it felt like they were both two stories happening at the same time with different puzzles and bosses involved this time it feels like the only difference is the first part of the game (navigating through the police station). After that everything feels pretty much the same. Both scenarios will have the same encounters and the same bosses. If we're considering that scenario A and scenario B are two stories that are happening at the same time as Leon and Claire go their own ways it makes no sense to consider that they're going through (mostly) the same events and fighting the same bosses.Still however this is very much an incredible remake that I easily recommend even at full price. Plus there is also free DLC coming up in the future as well.",RESIDENT EVIL 2 / BIOHAZARD RE:2,1,

The adaptive difficulty of the action RE games (4/5/6) is present though it feels unnecessary (punishing good aim and stockpiling rewarding the opposite) the ""zapping system"" (A/B scenarios) got ruined and there are some minor flaws but it's still a lot of fun.Ways that the game feels streamlined (perhaps too much for some purists decide for yourself) Like RE1's remake the map shows rooms as blue when there's no reason to keep searching them and red when there are items or anything that still needs to be interacted with in them Going near items marks them on the map Going near something an item can be used on marks it on the map removing the need to think about what to do next when points of interest can just be scanned on the map Like RE1's remake defense items can be used if they're equipped and an enemy grabs the player from the front keeping the player safe from damage whilst hurting or stunning enemies Inventory space can be upgraded to 20 slots allowing the player to carry multiple firearms ammo types defense items healing items and progression items Autosaves prevent much progress from being lost and make manual saves unnecessary most of the time there's less tension and more room for taking risks Manual saves don't require Ink Ribbons except on Hardcore difficulty which also has no autosavesEntering a new area is always tense in all the right ways and the locations lighting enemy design and controls all feel very polished but for fans of the original the most obvious issue it has as a remake is that the A/B scenarios have been watered down leaving all four possible scenarios' game progression and puzzles largely the same and producing unnecessary inconsistencies within the story despite the developers saying before release that their focus was on telling one more coherent story.In the original version whichever character gets picked first is used in the ""A"" scenario afterwards the other character gets a ""B"" scenario producing four different playthroughs (Leon A/Claire B and Claire A/Leon B) all with varying puzzles areas and story. There are choices made in the first scenario that affect the second such as picking between the Side Pack or Machine Gun in one will leave the unpicked item in the other not blowing up a certain boss will lead to it being a boss in B burning vines in one area will prevent them from appearing in B a gas can be used to make enemies weaker but it will make an enemy in B poisonous and lots more. None of these design choices are in the remake.The remake's scenarios are dumbed down with B runs simply having a slightly different route through the first part of the Police Station and slightly different solutions to the same puzzles. The route through Leon A and B is about 90% the same as it is for Claire A and B and the only differences between Leon and Claire's routes are very minor (relating to Leon's interactions with Ada and Claire's with Sherry). Puzzles are the same across all scenarios and solutions in Claire A and Leon A are the same just as solutions in Claire B and Leon B are the same. The Tyrant (Mr. X) is now in both scenarios instead of just B and no longer drops anything so there's not much reason to fight him. A more consistent story may have been a worthy trade off for the developer simplifying things but all four scenarios share so much now they end up contradicting each other more than before especially around the third boss where things stop making sense.In a relyonhorror interview shortly before release RE2 remake producer Yoshiaki Hirabayashi said ""We have a Leon campaign and a Claire campaign they re separate and you can choose which one you want to play first. We did simplify it a bit and make it more elegant by eliminating the A/B distinction and sort of meshing together what happens to the character s A and B scenarios into one story. I think players today they want these sort of deep/intense experiences with the story and by stretching it across 4 scenarios the story gets spread a little thin and create a sense of repetition by going through the game multiple times to see everything. So for that reason we went with two campaigns that still show all the events of each character s story rather than have it all split up.""It looks like they changed their minds and rushed the A/B runs in because now the remake has them and they're much more poorly thought out and lacking in replay value than the original.There's not much variety in any of the bosses and without spoiling anything you'll be pretty used to how they thrash about by the end of the first scenario. One boss from the original is relegated to one of those silly RE6 style sequences where you have to run towards the camera and avoid one hit game overs. Both scenarios have four bosses three of which the same and the B scenario gets a fifth boss (which in all fairness should not really be considered a boss). The bosses exclusive to Leon and Claire in the remake were not exclusive in the original.The scene introducing the Tyrant is gone and now there's nothing to explain anything about it. The scene that explains the helicopter crash very early in the game is gone so now it seems to have just crashed randomly. Leon and Claire can no longer meet in the multiple locations in the R.P.D. nor can Leon happen across Sherry like he could in Leon B. There are some missing enemy types (Giant Spiders Super Lickers Giant Moth...). The Bow Gun is missing which is a shame as it's somewhat of a signature weapon for Claire in RE2 and Code Veronica. Unlockable costumes are now paid DLC. Extreme Battle mode is gone. Individually these things don't seem much but all together and with the way the A/B scenarios are handled the remake starts to feel lacking.The remake changed Ada and Sherry's sections and tried to make some original contributions to the story but these happen to be the worst sections of the game. They're very limited in gameplay they both have one screw up and it's game over sections and Ada has this terribly out of place hacking gun that can magically turn anything on or off and redirect power wherever she wants.Cutscenes are very well directed. Some of the dialogue and files could have done with another pass. A lot of details from files in the original are missing. The 'Letter from Best Friend' that Claire starts with is a perfect example of how to write exposition very badly. Chief Irons' taxidermy log reads a bit juvenile for the sake of trying to make an already gross character seem more vulgar. Leon and Claire swear during encounters with enemies which is fine initially but on repeat playthroughs it starts to feel unnecessary. Voice acting is good but the music is ambient to a fault and it feels like most of the game is devoid of it.Performance is very good in my experience though there are minor graphical issues they don't spoil the experience.My first playthrough was thorough and at the results screen my times were 4h40m as Claire and 3h10m as Leon though some players may take double that time. Repeat playthroughs don't pass the 2 hour mark (without cutscenes).It's not a perfect remake like the one the first RE got but it's nice to see the series return to its roots again.",RESIDENT EVIL 2 / BIOHAZARD RE:2,1,

3350,"2019-01-30",0,0,22,0,1,I've only completed Leon's Campaign so far but I've heard enough about the others to give my opinion about this game. UPDATE FOR February 2nd 2018. I've completed Jill's 2nd run and my review still stands Overall this is the best RE game in my opinion. It has good aiming and controls like the actiony RE games it has the overall design philosophy and presentation of RE7 that makes it feel like a true modern survival horror game and brought some improvements similar to the first REmake and it's built in a way that makes it feel like the developers loved and respected the original game. I think the pros are obvious here but now I'm going to list the few cons.Narrative Annette Birkin apparently has two different death scenes in a single A/B run. Not sure what happened here.Also the way the different scenarios are structured feel more character exclusive than scenario exclusive like in the original. For example Claire's ''A'' story is the same as her ''B'' story. The same holds true for Leon there are slight differences but they're not as substantial as the original. Also the only differences in gameplay between the A and B scenarios ( for any character) is that the RPD is remixed a bit and the endings play out differently. I ultimately understand this issue since I'm pretty sure it requires more time and resources to produce 4 unique plotlines compared to the 5th generation but it's still a bit dissapointing. The game itself is still very well designed and we're getting free DLC that reveals some side stories so I guess that's where the energy is being put.Visual The Screen spaced reflections as they are now present too many artifacts this should be resolved in a future patch.Altogether this is still an excellent remake and return to form for the series.

3386,"2018-02-15",5,163,496,1,1,"I love card games of all types. I grew up playing traditional card games like Crazy Eights Solitaire and Uno. I later got into Bridge Rummy and Poker until Magic the Gathering (MtG) consumed my life for years.These days though its hard to find people to play traditional card games anymore and Magic the Gathering and other CCG's are way too expensive to keep up to date with.A few years ago I discovered physical deck building games like Dominion Thunderstone Race for the Galaxy and many more. I had a ton of fun playing these but again it is hard to get a group together on a consistent basis so I turned to the PC. Several of these games have pretty good PC versions but they are still restricted by the fact that they are based on physical games. There are often clunky mechanics that really slow things down. That's fine when playing with friends at home but over the Internet or alone against an AI it tends to get old pretty fast.There have been quite a few digital card games recent years that are great but most of them are based on card collecting and those can rival even Magic the Gathering in cost if you want to stay up to date with the best cards.Then come Slay the Spire A game it took me weeks of hearing people talk about before I finally gave it a chance. This little weird looking card game has somehow managed to tap into so many things I love about card games and video games that when people ask me about it I struggle to even say anything about it because there is so much I want to say.Drawing your cards The reason I love card games today as much as I did as a kid is for the simple feeling you get when you are dealt your cards you pick them up and see if you have a good hand. That rush of excitement at the possibilities of what your hand has for you never gets old its why I got so heavily into Magic the Gathering since apposed to games like Bridge or Rummy you get to draw new cards constantly. This is also true for deck builders and even more so with Slay the Spire than many others since you play your hand fast and don't have to worry about building your deck while you're playing it. This brings me to my second point...Building the deck Slay the Spire has done a genius move by taking the deck building aspects of a deck builder away from the action of playing. So when I am in a ""fight"" I don't have to think for 2 minutes about which card to get like you have to do in Dominion style games. After a fight is over you are rewarded with a selection of new cards and only then do you have to make decisions about what card to pick. And that choice is always informed by how the last battle went so you know what your deck is missing before you pick your new card. I really love building my deck as I play with it its how I used to tinker with my MtG decks back in the day and the reason why the physical deck building games appealed so much to me. Slay the Spire has the incremental building of a deck builder but without the constant ""stop and think"" style of play which slow those games down. This makes the pacing of the game much more interesting. You have an action phase followed by a thinking phase. Rather than jumbling them both into each other.Playing the cards All this would be for naught had the game not been fun to play. Thankfully the cards are interesting and have a ton of cool interactions with each other. There are many different types of decks you can build and they can often change and adapt as you play if you find that one rare card or relic you can build a whole deck around. This makes the game extremely re playable more so than any other deck builder I've played. While games like Dominion and Thunderstone have a lot of different card combinations for you to play I simply find myself enjoying what I can do in Slay the Spire more. It also plays very fast it flows a bit like Heartstone in that sense unless you have very complicated deck combinations which requires some forethought or specific play orders.Best of both worlds Since Slay the Spire is a digital card game rather than a physical one it is not restricted to the ""laws"" that govern how a regular card game plays. This means they can do a lot of stuff that simply isn't possible or takes too long for physical games. Each fight is against one or several monsters who before your turn indicate what they are going to do over their heads which usually is either attack block or apply some buff/debuff. This means what you do on your turn is informed by that. If the monster attacks you block if it blocks or buffs itself you attack. Having this kind of AI interaction in a physical game could be possible but would require a lot of dice rolling or boring set up between rounds. As you play the game more you start to learn how the different monsters work and develop strategies for each of them making each game a little easier than the previous. Its not just your deck that's getting better its your ability to play it as well.The game also has a lot of statuses such as buffs and debuffs kind of like how MtG works which is one of the reasons why MtG can take forever to play but with the game being digital all this is taken care of in the background. The digital version of Magic the Gathering handles these things for you as well but since its rooted in a physical game it is a lot slower and more cumbersome than Slay the Spire.Just one more turn... I am also a huge turn based strategy fan Civilization being my favorite game of the genre. That genre has the ability to captivate me in a way that makes me just play on and on one more turn at a time even though I know I should have stopped hours ago. Slay the Spire does the same thing for me. Each game of Slay the Spire consists of 3 floors with multiple encounters with a boss at the end of each floor if you die or win you get some experience points towards new unlocks and you can start again on a new run. It plays similarly to a Rogue Like in that way a genre that I've always been fascinated by but never got very deep into but Slay the Spire got its hooks into me very hard. It took me quite the force of will to say ""No"" to another game so I could take the time to write this review. I can't wait until its over so I can try out the latest patch. Which reminds me...Early Access The elephant in the room in my opinion is the fact that the game is in Early Access. That to me is always a HUGE red flag. There are a few games though such as Factorio Rim World Subnautica Prison Architect Oxygen Not Included and others that actually listen to their community provide regular updates and already have a game that is worth playing as it is. Slay the Spire in my opinion joins the rank of these great games without question. The technical aspects of the game is top notch it plays smoothly there's a ton of content and it has received multiple significant updates over the few weeks I've played it. With a clearly defined Roadmap that promise more content in a game I feel already has enough content to justify its price 5 times over. I have no doubt that the game will be finished and even if development stopped today I would be more than satisfied with my purchase.Finishing thoughts This is a game I am going to be playing for years to come and while it already has enough content to justify that today I can imagine limitless possibilities for it in the future. More game modes such as infinite restricted cards special relics or modifiers new cards more monsters new characters etc. I feel like this game has managed to do one of those things that you don't really see all that often. It has taken the best from many different genres combined it in a new way and created something greater than the sum of its parts.I think Slay the Spire is a game we will be talking about for years to come as a genre defining game.

3409,"2018-11-22",0,0,109,1,1,Slay the Spire has provided an unbelievable amount of entertainment. Even though it's in Early Access it's easy to lose hundreds of hours playing it. Modding can expand that number significantly as well.The game is a run based deck building rogue lite. You select from one of three classes that begin with a starting deck of 10 12 cards. As you progress through the map you choose which rooms to visit attempting to climb up 50 floors to reach the final act. Each room can contain shops events combats or campfires where you can choose to rest and restore HP or upgrade a card. Winning a combat will give you three cards to choose from to add to your deck (or you can skip the rewards) and elite enemies will also provide a relic which offer a variety of passive bonuses.The mechanics are simple to learn but provide immense depth and strategic possibilities both in combat and deck building. The devs have been responsive and communicative with updates and patches being delivered regularly. Overall the game is tremendously fun and highly 1.,Slay the Spire,1,

3430,"2018-11-21",0,0,47,1,1,I've played a deck builder or two (or just Hearthstone) in my time but never managed to get invested in exploring the possibilities presented until Slay the Spire. It's certainly a game you can run through without extensive thought or knowledge of the potentialities but there's quite a bit of fun to be found along with extensive but shortlived frustration in developing your knowledge and building for a particular skew or making decisions that turn out to be far more synergized with your deck than you had previously believed.Though you are likely to lose more runs than you probably will be happy with due to stage layout or draw RNG there are so many moments where satisfaction abounds in this game and the developers are both open eared and responsive to the community which is more than anyone could reasonably ask for.,Slay the Spire,1,

3434,"2018-06-23",24,109,35,1,1,I fell asleep in the middle of trying to finish just one more run and woke up with the controller still in my hand the next day. This hasn't happened to me since I was a little kid so I felt the game deserved an early review. Fun and addictive turn based rogue lite featuring turnbased card combat as it's main gameplay mechanic. Fair RNG Multiple characters with their own cards and playstyles a real solid difficulty curve that rewards strategy and punishes carelessness. Though it is in early access and more content is always appreciated the core gameplay loop is complete and very entertaining. A quick browse shows the developers update the game on a weekly basis and seem fairly responsive to community concerns and ideas. Definitely recommend investing into the game before it leaves early access and it's price increases. It is still rough around some edges with some interface graphic bugs occassionally and one run ending bug that prevented selection with both the left mouse button and my controller but that has only happened once so far. Restarting my game fixed it for me but some report you might need a system restart. Controller support could use SteamAPI intergration if you are like me you will need to fiddle with your Pro controller in the game setting and get used to wrong Xbox positioned icons being displayed for your face buttons. The developers seem aware of the issues and hassles and are looking into it.,Slay the Spire,1,
3435,"2018-03-19",16,186,298,1,1,I don't have a lot of time for gaming anymore and with around 1000 games in my library I've never even played I'm trying to cut back on buying new ones. So when a friend told me I had to play this one I was skeptical. I do love card games and strategy but I also have a lot of burnout from poor Early Access experiences and since my maternity leave is over and now I have to ugh make money AND look after a baby absolutely no spare time for gaming. So I surprised myself when I realized that three days after launching this I'd managed to clock up 15 hours. That pile of paperwork next to me the unfinished laundry and my mums messages asking if I'm okay because she hasn't heard from me for a few days may be related in some way but you can't prove anything! I was so tired last night I beat the final boss with the Ironclad for the first time sent a screenshot to the friend who bullied me into playing the game (essential step) turned my PC off walked to bed and fell asleep to dream of deck building.Despite my friend having played double my hours and generally being vastly superior at games to me his playstyle choices have been vastly different. He prefers Silent the poison character whereas I prefer Ironclad the strength deck. He'd never used the style of deck I used to get my first win (barricade massive armor stacking dual wield into body slam) and I played with quite a few different deck types before settling on my winning synergy. Even though there are not a massive array of cards there is a significant amount of choice and strategy in your play coupled with constant adjustments needing to be made as you pick up relics and rewards.With over 9 000 reviews (no I mean literally that's not a meme) and overwhelmingly positive you don't need someone slow to this bandwagon to describe the mechanics of the game. What I will say is this is a fun roguelike deck building card game that is simple to grasp hard to master and incredibly addictive. I'd love to say it can be played in short bursts when you have 30 minutes here and there but only if you've levelled your willpower to max and can walk away from the PC.Highly 1 from me even in Early Access with hopefully even more content to come.

3446,"2018-06-13",0,0,19,1,1,TL DR Sum up Slay the Spire has players fighting with cards through a semi randomly generated dungeon and build their character and deck with random drops. Slay the Spire has players struggling screaming raging then asking for more because that s how fun Slay the Spire is. Based on challenging and enjoyable mechanics which palliate for its lack of artistic polish and uneven pacing its formula is meant for challenge seekers to which I recommend it even at its current price. Newcomers to either card battle games or rogelike/lites might want to wait for a discount.

Combats are fought by carefully picking cards which will trigger various offensive defensive and strategic effects. Along the way players will build their character thanks to random card gold and bonus drops in hope of finally reaching the top and eventually restart from the bottom and/or compete in a daily run event. Three different playable characters are available each with their own set of cards and unique gameplay. The strength of the title is undoubtedly its combat and deck building mechanics where players will have to improvise and make sweet sweet lemonade of of runs that sometimes feel like the ultimate lemon storm card and bonuses drops obtained after clearing a floor are random and if a build will certainly evolve throughout a given run how it will evolve is down to luck and very strategic choices. There is something to be said about a heavy reliance on RNG. The game can at times feel frustratingly random in its difficulty (I almost beat it during my first run then struggled for the next 8 hours). That said card games are random by nature and this formula is meant to appeal to players who enjoy facing strong and uncertain odds. To somewhat balance this built in unfairness though the developers have implemented a forced flush mechanic where unplayed cards automatically go to a flush pile after ending a turn. This system helps knowing what card will come next and allows nice little tricks such as digging in the flush pile for that one card that might very well change the issue of the battle. If the combat and gameplay of Slay the Spire are a lot of fun some other aspects could benefit from a lot more polish. The art is sometimes painful to watch (bonfire screens in particular need a lot more work) and I personally found the music and sound effect lacking impact. Too standard and repetitive to be immersive no dynamic soundtrack very few sound effects for the variety of cards provided and generally forgettable themes I do play on mute. That said the game still being in early access there is still hope for improvement and in any case the art doesn t matter that much once a combat has started. Technically the only real downside of the game is its animations. With no variety whatsoever they are also slow enough (even on their fastest setting) to account for a good 30% of a turn s time depending on how fast players take their decisions. With nothing to justify this length and no skip option they increase the duration of single runs and decrease the fun/time ratio. Added to the general boredom of the first 2 or 3 fights and a title that could be much more nervous currently suffers for an unequal pace that can become uncomfortable. VerdictSlay the Spire is based on challenging and enjoyable mechanics which palliate for its lack of artistic polish and uneven pacing. Its fresh appealing formula is meant for challenge seekers to which I recommend it even at its current price. Newcomers to either card battle games or rogelike/lites might want to wait for a discount.,Slay the Spire,1,

The battles feel fun and slightly chaotic (especially when you get good and turn on fast mode) the ""?"" room encounters are fun well written and sometimes create genuine dilemmas in your head about the best way to proceed. Amassing a trove of relics is great fun too and of course helps to shape a different run every single time. Slay the Spire is an A+ and an absolute steal at what they're selling it for. Good on ya Mega Crit.",Slay the Spire,1,
3453,"2018-11-19",0,0,33,1,1,Extremely intuitive game there is almost no learning curve beyond simply learning what some card keywords mean but you will be able to understand nearly all mechanics of the game within one or two attempts. I've found Slay the Spire to be fun while both try harding to reach ever higher levels and while creating meme decks to kill your enemies in ridiculous ways with. Its endless replayability and depth make it well worth its cost and it isn't even fully finished yet. Don't let the fact that it's in early access fool you though the elements that are included are fairly polished and the devs are constantly in communication with the players getting feedback and improving the game while simultaneously adding in new content to mix up the game.,Slay the Spire,1,

3457,"2018-04-14",4,46,142,1,1,I bought this game 5 days ago and have played it for 50 hours. I don't even know how that's possible. All I know is this game is a steal at the current price. Do you like the board Game Dominion? Do you like card games or Rogue like random generation games that are quite difficult? Then you'll probably love this. Even well into playing this game I was constantly surprised by the different deck options and combos open to me not once did a run feel stale or bland. Checking my stats I was surprised to find I've only finished this game 11 times I thought It was way more than that. If that ratio of beating the game sounds depressing to you and you like to win a lot this may be the one factor dissuading you from purchasing. But the mechanics are so addictive everything is so smooth that for me the journey is fun enough. This may be the best early access title I have every played. I can't believe it is still a work in progress as the game right now is really polished with more classes updates and card tweaks happening every week. Very much 1!,Slay the Spire,1,

3459,"2018-11-05",0,0,117,1,1,This game's value kind of sneaks up on you after a few (probably failed) run throughs. It's not an easy game and it doesn't tell you the best combos or deck building strategies so some practice is required. But after doing this awhile you can see the depth. I have to admit there's a lot of fun to be had when you've managed to put together a very strong deck and you can just blaze through floors in the spire. And every run is different so simply knowing what the best strategy is will not be enough for each situation.I hope they add more characters.

3462,"2018-11-22",0,0,185,1,1,"Slay the Spire is an amazing piece of work. Emphasis on ""work"" because it has been forged reforged and polished to a mirror shine via weekly updates and beta testing throughout its Early Access run. For myself I enjoy playing a run or two every few days. There's no harm in taking breaks unlike many games there's no penalty for putting it down for a while.Slay the Spire stands as an excellent deckbuilder that encourages you to change your strategy through its myriad of ways to earn lose and upgrade cards. It gives a consistent yet variable setup that is easy to understand but will take time to understand and master. The base layer of the game consists of picking one of the three characters the Attack focused Ironclad the Skill based Silent and the Power pushing Defect. All three characters have different archetypes and can earn a few character specific relics. All three have very strong options for climbing the Spire and can use a multitude of strategies to defeat each floor. It's difficult to find a consensus about which character is ""overpowered"" as each character appeals to a different playstyle.Though it is a single player game there are Daily Climbs that let you fight your way up the spire with three special modifiers rotating out every 24 hours where you share the same seed and run with every other player. These modifiers are also available through Custom runs which allows even more variation.",Slay the Spire,1,

The mechanics are easy to pick up yet full of depth so you are always rethinking and evolving your stategies. The gameplay is fast and you rarely need to stop and crunch numbers keeping things moving.One of the best features is the daily challenge where a random set of modifications to the default rules are applied leading to a run that rarely plays out like a typical one preventing things from feeling stale. As well difficulty scaling via the ""Ascention"" system makes sure that the game is as challenging as you are able to handle.The developers seem to be great with updates and bug fixes released weekly though I've not encountered many (if any) bugs myself.Pros Great artwork / production values Runs great / Bug free Quick to learn Depth of strategy Difficulty scales well to your abilityCons Sometimes fast mode isn't fast enough and you are left waiting quite a while for an action to complete I often need to restart steam for the daily leaderboards to work properly",Slay the Spire,1,

Anyways this game is fantastic! If you're a fan of Hearthstone and enjoy the Dungeon run feature this game is perfect for you! I'm sure fans of deck building games in general though will throughly enjoy this.Currently there are only 2 playable classes in the game but with the random relics cards and other events you'll happen upon almost every play through will be different. There are plenty of fun combos and deck builds that you will discover but probably not be able to replecate on your next few runs which is great as you'll find one you like even better!TLDR If you like Hearthstones dungeon run or any deck building game do yourself a favor and get this right now!,Slay the Spire,1,

3480,"2018-11-22",0,0,117,1,1,Slay the Spire is simply the best at what it does. If you like deck builders roguelikes or high risk strategy games then this might be the perfect game for you.Slay the Spire is a deckbuilding game where your card choices are random each game and incredibly important to winning. You are given a choice of 3 heroes (which determine your abilities and cards available) at the beginning of a run and you use your deck to fight battles. The map is randomized and you get a choice in what path you take through the Spire. Will you risk an Elite battle to get a relic or will you rest to assure you can survive the final boss? You choose cards as you go and eventually make a deck that wins a run or loses on the way.The choices go deep and even 90 hours in I'm discovering new deck combinations that do and don't work. The endgame has great content that constantly forces you to re learn what you know about the game and try new things. On top of this every day there's a custom run for a leaderboard as well as customizable runs.It's worth noting that the devs are very involved in the game. It's keeps things fresh but is occasionally confusing. If you boot up without reading patchnotes you may find that something you used to use has been changed. New room types and cards can get added. It's always in the best interest of the game but this is still an Early Access title. That said these devs are super adament about weekly patches and adding in things as they go. It's a blast to keep current with and the changes are never huge or unfair to a specific style of play.I'd definitely recommend this game to anyone who likes deckbuilders or roguelikes. It keeps you on your toes but isn't hard to learn or get good at. It's just about the perfect singleplayer card game.,Slay the Spire,1,

3482,"2018-11-22",0,0,36,1,1,Amazing dungeon crawler deck building card game! The cards are well designed and allow many different paths to play so playing the same class can still result in a multitude of different strategies. Regular enemies and bosses are beautifully designed. Overall the characters background sound effects and music supported the adventures through the dungeons really well. Unlocking new cards for each character can be a bit slow but with daily changing game modes it is great fun and easily done.Overall a wonderful game that fills countless hours with fun and adventures.,Slay the Spire,1,

3556,"2018-12-02",0,0,76,1,1,Good casual card game. Like Darkest Dungeon but with cards. It even has a very similar vibe and feel. It's pretty complex too. You need to spend quite some time learning the cards and how to mix and match them to make your deck great and overall powerful no matter what enemy you are going to face next. And there are 3 characters who are very different one from another so you'll gonna need to triple your learning time to be able to play all of them correctly to their strengths.Slay the Spire has a perfect length for a run usually 40 60 minutes 3 acts (4th act is very small with a few fights). And 20 difficulty levels. That's what made me play this game non stop for more than a week before I beat the Ascension level 20 with the Ironclad. It was super fun at the start but once you get to ascension level 15+ the game becomes more about how lucky you are to get the right cards and relics in act 1. If you are not so lucky you will probably die in latter half of first act and have to try once again. I needed about 13 15 runs on average to complete Ascension levels 18 20. it wasn't fun and challenging at the same time but more like a grind. The balance is really off on those difficulty levels. Most cards are pretty bad or mediocre at best. And if you don't get lucky the end.I think that this game lacks variety in enemies. You always gonna face the same enemies on act 1 on each playthrough the same on act 2 and so on. With the same HP with the same compositions with mostly the same attack patterns. After a while everything becomes very mechanical. it really doesn't matter which path you choose because of the way this game works. Once you start a run everything is already predetermined. It has 4 starting different paths most of the time but every single first enemy on each path will be the same every second also. The same can be said about question marks chests and elite reward drops. So no matter what you choose you will probably end up with a very similar result when you reach an act boss. That's pretty sad tbh.I needed 65h to complete the game on all Ascension levels with 1 character. I bet it would take me another 120+ hours to do the same with other 2. That's a lot of rinse and repeat if you want to be a completionist. But the minute I did actually complete Ascension Level 20 I just lost all the desire to do so with other characters. I don't know. The drive is just no there anymore. Maybe It's just a burnout on my end or maybe because I already know everything and experienced everything so many times. Hmmm.Still a good game with a handful of flaws and issues here and there.,Slay the Spire,1,

There's a reason so many others have tried to rip this game off already. It's damn near perfect for what it is. If you've ever played the dungeon run mode in hearthstone it's slightly similar to that but with much added depth in terms of the 'Relics' you acquire which effect your cards and actions in various ways. The assembling of sets of relics is not unlike the binding of issac's combinations. Admittedly one of the classes the silent is a bit RNG focused with it being difficult to assemble winning combos but on the whole the games' RNG is acceptible which for a game like this is absolutely critical. Rarely will you ever feel too unfairly treated.I highly recommend this game to fans of card games and roguelikes both.,Slay the Spire,1,

3613,"2017-12-10",0,0,185,1,1,I'll start of by saying I'm very considerate when spending money on games (most of my library games were gifted from a good friend and from in game currency trough trading).I have DayZ and that was a lesson to never trust Early Acess games but after I saw some good reviews I decided to take a chance with this game and hey worst case scenary I'll get a refund.I haven't played much but the time that I played flew.The game can be picked up left mid dungeon and picked back up again which really helps it.The RNG is there (it's a card game so it's unavoidable) but all my losses never felt random I either made mistakes when choosing cards or in combat itself.The two characters are distinct enough and the looming prospect of more to come is amazing (Mega Crit Games PLEASE DON'T ADD MICROTRANSACTIONS BY THE WAY).Super polished and really well done for an Early Acess Game good luck with this devs.I currently have 2.3 hours played but I'm pretty sure it'll skyrocket soon probably my favourite game purchase this year really recommend the game. EDIT Played for more than a few hours now and it's still a blast every time I play it devs constantly and free of charge update the game with comunity feedback absolutly great devs.I'd be more than willing to pay for DLC from these devs the game is worth more than it's being sold for.Nominated for game of the year!,Slay the Spire,1,

With three very different characters to choose from 20 modifiers to the difficulty to unlock and struggle through and a fourth concluding act to take your super powerful deck and turn it into a pile of garbage Slay The Spire is an excellent rogue like experience. One round often takes 30 min 1 hour which is the bite size appeal I like for my schedule these days.,Slay the Spire,1,
3616,"2018-11-21",0,0,66,1,1,Product received for free. A truly great game worth checking out. Its been updated regularly with interesting content enhancing an already stellar game jam packed with content. The game feels fairly well balanced and the daily missions allow for some added chaos to spice up the average run. Its also a pretty lightweight game that most computers could probably run without too many issues. Only small gripe is the bosses can be pretty brutal if you dont have good combos but it gets easier to know whats good or bad for the current run as time goes on. Overall an excellent game thats worth full price if you like strategy or card games and a definite buy if on sale.,Slay the Spire,1,

3629,"2018-03-03",0,0,174,1,0,"*UPDATEST*The continuous additon of content has reduced reliability and made the game far more play by flowchart than a ""draft card game"" you will not succeed unless you follow the flowchart.Further they have released a patch which has made a large amount of random content non random and it has been in this state for over a week so it seems like they've lost track of their own process.*UPDATER*I gave this game a specific trial based on a 14 day of playing the game doing only dailies for evaluation. While I still feel like this game is largely more of a great base framework with a lot of ""potential"" as a game (and I wont recommend something on what it could be) 14/14 dailies have been at wost ""not that bad"" and many of them have been thoroughly enjoyable.On this point I believe that this game is at the very least a wonderful lunch break game and even in that worth the money.I have varying opinions on the rest of the content in the game but I've encountered no obvious bugs crashes or other issues so it is a heavily polished Early Acccess title and you can get your money out of it without ever touching anything but dailies so I do feel comfortable in recommending it at this point. Left in here for posterity *UPDATE*After putting more time into the game I'm actually giving it a more hard non recommend.While the game has a lot of the potentials of a good roguelike the RNG elements of the game are far too heavy in a lot of the arenas. Fairness mentioned below is recanted. As you progress up the difficulty ladder you will be fundamentally discouraged from experimentation in any fashion and encouraged to play what amounts to ""winmore"" strategies at the lower difficulty levels.There's a really neat potential for discovering unique combinations of deck combinations and plays but the requirement for good luck and system mastery (read following prescripted deck archetypes and combinations) is an extreme detractor from elements of long term fun.This ultimately magnifies my complaints below as the more you try to challenge yourself in the game the less the game is willing to let you play it.*ORIGINAL*On the whole I would recommend the game. It's a great blend of roguelike and card game. However due to Steam having no nuanced review system this review must be negative because the positive recommendations amalgmate a percentage that is higher than it should be. People will comfortably select this purchase simply based on the suggested consensus.The part that makes me unwilling to go with the consensus is due to that almost all of the flaw of the game is packed into the first 1/3 of any given game. The potential of the game to produce certain combinations and actions of which produce the fun of the game do not generally begin happening any earlier than the first half of the first (of three) floors. Even if you succeed through the first floor that first half is frequently a non game because the decision making process is minimal assuming it exists at all. You will spend a large chunk of your game experience here during the learning curve and even then when hit with bad RNG. You can out play the game and get past such things it's not that the game is usually unfair about that but those actions are commonly an element of delaying until you can get something that works.You do get a little bit of a mixup at the beginning of most runs but it is just more RNG gamble that doesn't generally do much to change things.For a comparison that's probably almost cliche Binding of Isaac. Now it's not without flaw (nor without degeneration over each of the misguided expansions and booster packs) but each segment of the game offers the general promise of two items to improve your gameplay the item room and boss item. By analogy in this game there is no guarantee of items at any point from the first two items rooms and boss. They may eixst but they may also not.It's fully valid for a game to be designed with different foci in mind but to me the analogy isn't mere comparison The lack of immediate variation in a run kills the enjoyment of multiple runs of the game in succession. This wouldn't be a huge issue if it weren't for the fact that again that portion of the game is going to be a large portion of the experience.While each run of the spire is different in pathing the paths are not unique unto themselves such as a floor layout and the contents of the rooms in Binding of Isaac would be they amount more to the sequences of choices you intend to make. It's not a bad design decision but it all compounds to make the early game commonly feel like a waste of time where you pay for real world time with in game HP which leads to probablistic decrease in survival chance due to patience and real life being a thing.That rant aside and if you've gotten this far and especially if you're willing to deal with the above you're probably not going to regret the purchase. The game is early access so there are more than a few things yet to be added refined etc so there's still room for my complaints to be fixed and the rest of the experience to be refined.",Slay the Spire,1,

This is a great game being developed by a small indie group of game devs who actually care what their community has to say (they took the time to directly respond to me because of my issues with Red Shell). If you ever enjoyed or wanted to try any of the versions of Harvest Moon or its like this game is a wonderful adaptation. It is still in early acess and already feels more polished than many big title games that are ""complete"". I have nothing but high hopes going forward and hope that the devs continue to care about their community and develop this amazing gem they have begun.**END EDIT**Game is a lot of fun and is a great game. However the Devs have chosen to include the spy ware ""RedShell"" with the game which tracks and stores all your online activity. The theory behind redshell is so that the dev can see whether you're googling their game but its tracking software and that is not okay.Devs please stop using redshell so I can continue to enjoy your great game that I was excited to purchase.

3640,"2018-12-19",16,370,162,1,1,"This is an incredible game and the best Early Access game I've played since Grim Dawn. I'm 70 hours into this game and it feels like a complete product to me. There are 0 bugs thus far. It is well optimized. I played some Animal Crossing back in the day on Game Cube and while it had its charm it felt limited to me. It certainly didn't pull me in the way this game does. This game has so much to do and much more depth to it than I was expecting going into it. There is a social aspect with the folks around town that is a mini game in its own including play dates gifting and completing crafting assignments mini missions or mini games like exercising a pet pig. Reaching certain friendship levels unlocks bonuses like store discounts and gifted items. There is a lot of repetitive mining which I personally find relaxing but the redundancy is broken up by the search for relics in the mines. Relic pieces combine into relics which can be placed in your house or the museum (which at certain quantities of donations grants special perks as well). In addition to crafting items you can assemble larger items from crafted items. These are frequently used in story progression. You can raise chickens ducks cows and sheep. You can own and ride horses. You can expand your property size and upgrade buildings. You can furnish your home. You can grow crops and trees. There are special events on the calendar such as snowball fights fishing contests a Halloween type event land run races etc.There are prizes for running a successful workshop.You can have a cat and a dog pet that hang around your house.You can do dungeon crawling (necessary for some crafting) or slaughter rainbow llamas for fur and poop (to make fertilizer for the garden). The dungeons are challenging early but you out level the low level one pretty quickly so its easy to burn through them for materials. There is a higher level dungeon later on in the story.There are day/night cycles. At late night the townsfolk hang at the restaurant which has a few mini games you can do without eating up clock time (darts slots and balloon shooting). These give badges to trade for items. There is a haunted cave mini game as well on a small island.When you take out enough animals/enemies higher level versions spawn with special rewards.The story is good. The characters are good. The music is good. Controls are easy. Inventory space is plentiful at reasonable upgrade cost.If I am pressed to find flaws it would be that the clock goes so fast. You have to basically pick one thing per game day to do and spend the rest of the time managing your workshop. But that works out fine and a game day takes about 30 minutes of real life time which is nice for a short game session. It's also addictive though that its hard to only play one game day!The biggest negative would be the slowness of certain story progression missions. Some crafting materials are not as plentiful as others and when you need 60 of that material the game can drag a bit. I find ""mucus"" to be the most awful thing to farm. It drops off a small handful of creatures and only 1 at a time but it is needed in a number of important recipes. Most missions are not timed however so you get there when you get there. No big deal.Travel distances seem to be increasing but there are fast travel locations and the horse helps with that.Update At 115 hours now I've finished the story thus far and am looking forward to future story content. I discovered the Civil Corps office where you can set commissions for the NPCs to carry out for you and retrieve a variety of items for you such as the hard to obtain mucus I previously mentioned. I courted and married Emily who helps me around the workshop by taking care of the animals and crops. It adds a little more time to my clock each day. I've attained all buildings including the factory which I have mixed feelings about. Factory pros Reduces occupied land. Powered through one central battery that I easily filled for the next 120 game days. Significant numbers of slots instead of 1 slot per machine so production quantity is increased quite a bit. A 300 item storage space for the workshop to pull materials from.Factory cons The item storage isn't connected to the house meaning you have to store certain materials in the workshop others in the house. And you can't easily have say 250 iron bars in the workshop and the remainder in the house because the sort all buttons may carry things you didn't mean to put in that location. I found it best to keep all base materials in the workshop and all manufactured items in the house. But I still do need to split and manage where my bars are to keep up production of things like bronze pipes and steel sheets. It would be nice if it was all one shared item pool. No idea where materials are being allocated to. You can set up a dozen slots of iron bars a dozen slots of steel bars etc and it doesn't subtract those items from your inventory as you build the slots. So sometimes I would end up overreaching and end up with a bunch of slots that couldn't be completed because I ran out of iron or copper ore. There doesn't seem to be a need for so many slots. Even mining every day I can't fill every available slot and I probably only have 20/30 machines set up. I try to run multiple small quantity slots but still can't max out my slots. After the story is over there isn't really enough to do but collect materials and build relationships which at that point are not all that necessary. For materials I'm at 1500 glass 1000+ of each bar 400+ of each plate 350+ of each pipe 1500 charcoal etc. and nothing to do with them since I can only do one commission per game day and only 5 out of every 7 game days. That sounds like a complaint. I suppose it is when it really shouldn't be. The ability to get 115 hours out of a game in Early Access for $15 is incredible. The story is over (until the next update). That is the natural end for most games which are often far shorter and more expensive. It's only a complaint because I enjoyed the game so much that I want to play more! And while nothing stops me from logging in and mining which I'm sure I will do because it's a chill way to kill some time I do wish there were some goals to strive towards in a game that feels like it doesn't really have an end.",My Time At Portia,1,

3642,"2018-01-23",4,198,33,1,1,"Guess I'll start off by saying I don't review many games but I feel like My Time At Portia deserves me taking the time to write one. Like in other reviews if you enjoy games like Stardew Valley Harvest Moon or Yonder type games you will definitely find enjoyment in My Time At Portia. Here are some of the Pros and Cons I have encountered in my first 10 hours.Pros For an early access game it is fairly free of bugs which is refreshing considering how EA games are released nowadays with many bugs and uses the crutch of ""EA"" to explain them. The few I have run in to were easily fixed by restarting my game and were nothing groundbreaking that made me lose time. Every aspect of the game is very well done. The crafting mining exploring building questing battling fishing ETC. all feel like someone took time to perfect them. Some times you may play games where one aspect of the game seems really good while other aspects seem lacking and usually you get a response like ""we are working on cleaning these things up and optimizing them in future patches"" again the EA crutch. MTAP has clearly taken the time to work on ALL aspects of the game making it very enjoyable. MTAP offers a more in depth take on the genre with things like the skill tree and leveling up system. It gives the game a bit more customization from playthrough to playthrough and player to player than say Stardew Valley does. I can easily see myself replaying through this game making different decisions each time. I love the little quirky things this game has to offer like the sparring mode and rock paper scissors. Its little things like this that happen out of the blue that make you think ""that was unexpected but I liked it!"" UPDATE Loving all of the things that are being fixed with patches like increased stack sizes etc. It really feels like the developers are listening to the community and making the changes needed to keep us happy! Cons Im not sure yet if the map is big enough. Seems like there are only a few zones to unlock. But with only 10 hours and not unlocking all of them to see how big they are or how much content each zone provides I can't say for sure this is a Con. For those who like to use controllers on these types of games like I do I found the sensitivity of the camera movement entirely too high. Even at the lowest setting if you just barely touch the joystick to move the camera it went crazy. This made using my controller not an option and went with the keyboard. Now if you don't use controllers then no problem but personally games like this I like to sit back and relax while playing making using a controller great! This is probably my biggest Con. (UPDATE Seems like they have fixed the camera sensetivity for controllers but I will say that using the controller for this isn't as fluid as say Stardew Valley but still nice that it seemed to get resolved quickly)Overall I would easily recommend this game for those who like this genre of games and those who aren't sure if they like this genre. Its fairly easy to figure out for beginners but also provides plenty of depth for those of us who have put many hours in to the genre. The game offers tons of content and plenty of replayability! I can't wait to see what the developers have in store for us in the future for My Time At Portia!",My Time At Portia,1,
3643,"2019-01-18",13,673,66,0,1,"In A Nutshell Pros + Charming post apocalyptic setting portrayed in a way making it lighthearted and mysterious at the same time.+ Immense quantity and variety of activities dungeon raids quests base building mining commerce lost technology recovery... and a lot more.+ Great art direction using colorful cartoon ish but also very detailed graphics to portray the world and characters.+ Decently written and quite interesting storyline and events unfolding.+ A successful blend of Management Sandbox and Open World Action RPG in equal parts offering exciting gameplay.+ Huge quantity of items to collect craft restore or win at events with cosmetics or home furniture giving meaningful gameplay bonuses.+ Well developed relationship system with NPCs leading to different interactions and content. Cons The game forces players to drop asleep at 3AM every in game day also teleporting them back at home when this happens. Very annoying while doing some activity. The sheer number of activities available can be overwhelming and disorienting for some players at first. Needs some getting used to.My Time At Portia (MTAP) is a sandbox game deserving capital ""S"" with an amazing quantity and quality of content. After covering the very basics a world of possibilities opens to players mining ancient ruins to gather minerals and technology accepting quests from citizens or the City to build infrastructure fighting monsters throughout the world and inside dungeons planting crops... there is just SO MUCH TO DO.Each of these activities has several ""tiers"" of complexity commissions will level up as you gather fame and respect as a builder (and citizen) of Portia becoming more rewarding but also complex. Dungeons feature several tiers containing harder better rewarding monsters while base building will need a lot of time and care in order to build an effective Workshop furnished with all the machines to face the most complex tasks without hiccups. Machines and appliances are often the result of intricate crafting more their level rises more complex this becomes. But is also the key of Portia's always fresh gameplay working towards an harder objective without making it frustrating.The Action RPG part of MTAP is surprisingly elaborate for the genre featuring multiple skill trees weapon and equipment stats character stats and even mechanics such as invincibility frames during dodge rolls and bosses with changing attack patterns when Hp is reduced inspired to the Souls genre but of course much more easy than that! Experience is gained from quests and activities such as resource gathering and combat and becomes exponentially longer to level up as character power increases.Overall MTAP is really an exemplar Open World Sandbox scoring high if not top marks in all fields from graphics to gameplay. For the proposed price considering the huge amount (and quality) of content it would be a CRIME not to get this game. In depth Feature Analysis Gameplay The gameplay of MTAP is divided into Base Management Quests Dungeon Raiding and Exploration. Base Management features completely free form placing of furniture machines and any other item to organize work as wanted. Materials deposited into storage chests are directly used without having to pick them up each time (except form items crafted at the Assembly Bench and specific base upgrades at shops in Portia) they are also organized in a handy global menu allowing players to select any chest from any other chest's location. These significant quality of life features a really clean interface make base management satisfying and not a chore. Upgrading of all facilities is available with the appropriate materials while Research Dungeons and Quests unlock more and more blueprints as the game progresses. Quests are given by NPCs global events such as festivals happenings or the City Hall board. Each quest rewards XP Reputation with that particular NPC or the City itself Gols (currency) and also sometimes unique blueprints items or other bonus content. Generally quests are about building something and delivering it to a specific location while other times are about exploring a certain part of the map or clearing a dungeon. Dungeon Raiding gives you three lives losing all HP results in a respawn at the start of the last dungeon floor but all enemies including bosses still have the damage inflicted to them. This makes clearing dungeon of par level decently easy. Clearing a dungeon results in great amounts of Lost Technology parts and aswell materials of many types. Each dungeon holds unique enemies and resources obtainable from it. Exploration of the game world is limited at first as many locations are inaccessible until specific quests have been completed or events happened. Even with this in mind the explorable part of the world right off the bat is large and there are many secret chests fishing spots monster spawns mineral veins to discover. Story Generally the main story is quite varied and interesting decently written. Secondary quests are aswell decently interesting portraying a wide variety of situations and shenanigans. NPCs are well characterized each with their own preferences when it comes to gifts actions and habits. Even if Story is not properly the strong suit of Sandbox titles Portia does a good job at it. Combat System Combat takes some inspiration from the Souls series but fear not it is much more forgiving than that featuring dodge rolls player stats such as critical chance DPS defense attack values and aswell skill trees to boost effectiveness. Weapons include melee ones but aswell pieces of Lost Technology later on such as firearms. Enemies are varied and each has unique attack patterns and effects. Unique rare monsters and bosses are several. Content &amp Pricing For a base price of 30 sporting a massive 50 60 hours for the main content ONLY while very well 100+ (a big +) for doing everything there is to do it's simply a bargain to good to refuse. Balance &amp Challenge Challenge in this type of game is not very high as standard but still some boss fights and dungeons can give a rough time if taken lightly. Balance is pretty decent with enemies of the same level being a fair challenge. Technical Analysis Graphics Magnificent colorful graphics simple in a certain fashion but also very detailed and cured. The art direction is simply great environments far reaching and inspiring weather effects design of models and choice of palettes is always top notch. Sometimes it seems to be playing a moving painting rather than a 3D game. And this is exactly what the developers wanted to convey. Sound Decent effects and soundtracks but sometimes especially in dungeons sounds seemed to disappear or not be played correctly but only in a few instances this happened. Performance &amp Stability Game runs flawlessly in 1440p at maxed settings. i7 4820K 16GB RAM GTX 1080 . Artificial Intelligence Enemy AI follows a pattern based and follow script typical of action RPGs. friendly NPC AI will make them follow a cycle of daily activities and participate events. Quality of Life Excellent features cutting out the annoying management parts leaving mostly the good ones. Bugs &amp Issues Nothing major to report.

3644,"2018-03-28",98,74,152,1,1,People are weird. I am one but I still don t understand them. What makes us get up every morning chop wood smash rocks build boxes and run screaming across the fields with a huge sword slaughtering every llama in sight?My Time At Portia. That s what. It would be easy to look at My Time At Portia as if it were another Harvest Moon style game. I mean you show up at a town because your grandpa died and left you the farm or whatever the backstory is you can grow crops chop wood annihilate llamas and build relationships with the townsfolk. Simple.But wait! Plot twist! I don t plant I ve got no crops. None. This is not a farming game. You can farm sure. But you don t have to. You can craft items for a living. You can fish. You can delve into ancient ruins. You can kill llamas. Kill. Kill. Kill. Over and over until the fields run red with the blood of defenseless fluffy creatures. Anyway.I guess I ve killed some llamas.I ve also done the wood chopping fishing ruin diving crafting socializing and house decorating that can be found here. The attention to detail is astounding. Just starting the game for the first time confronted with a character creation reminiscent of a Bethesda game with sliders for body parts full color pallete selection that would make Pantone blush and such a feeling of goodwill and professionalism that you know immediately how much thought was put into every aspect of this game.My Time At Portia is time well spent and I would talk more about it but I ve got to get back to the game. Those llamas aren t going to kill themselves.,My Time At Portia,1,
3645,"2018-01-31",1,83,110,1,1,This may be the best fun I had since Stardew Valley and Minecraft. Keep in mind this is only on my fun factor scale and no comparison to the aformentioned games. Although this game may be closer to the former than the latter. Well by a large margin.Simply put Aside from the obvious bugs as development happens this game has massive potential. Pros + Lots to do. Sometimes overwhelming.+ Cutesy graphics. I love the vibe this game brings.+ Plenty of places to explore. Secrets to find. + I like the combat aspect. Boss fights are satisfying for the most part.+ Characters have potential to be very memorable.+ Potential for cool DLC's or a modding community.+Relaxing!Cons (I am putting the obvious bugs aside as this is Early Access.) I can see the grind as a major turn off for some. I personally love it. I would encourage even more. More dialogue would be nice. This game needs very serious balance work. For instance penalty for passing out nerfing the rock loot making personal needs important such as hunger.My gripes are minimal. Sure this is going to make some butthurt. Oh well it's the Internet.,My Time At Portia,1,
3646,"2018-01-25",1,79,34,1,1,I'm a big fan of Harvest Moon and Stardew Valley and when I saw a youtuber do a video on this game drawing the comparisons I knew I had to try it out. It's yet another fresh take on the RPG fantasty games that exist becoming something more of Rune Factory (a fantasty spin off of Harvest Moon) with a new focus on crafting over farming. Obviously farming is included but instead of inheriting a farm you inherit a workshop. You're striving to become the best having rival workshops in the are. Resources can be a chalange to find the methods to find them are interesting and challanging and it isn't easy. Which in itself is refreshing as being challanged is what I want in such games. You can mine fish fight cut tree's grow produce likely tend to animals and I feel like you're not locked into just doing the farming. If you wanted you could focus on one area more and do only main quest requests to unlock more of the map. Character creation was also a nice surprise given the style of the game seems so basic at first glance. But as I went through the options there was more sliders than expected allowing me to customise as I wanted. Though I look forward to potential more voices being added rather than the current one. The back story is also so different and appealing for the world and I want to learn more about what happened before the games setting. I want to befriend the people living in Portia and it's not a chore to talk to anybody as they are so varried with their views ages behaviours and daily routines. Sure being in fresh into early access means there are a few hiccups but since buying the game I've seen it update three times. I already feel like more content is being added daily small bugs are fixed and controls adjusted that I can't wait to see where this game goes. If you're a fan of RPG's Harvest Moon Stardew Valley or even Rune Factory I can see this game appealing to you greatly. It's well worth you're time even now as there's so much to do in this beautifully crafted world.Pros Variety of NPC'sChallanging In depth worldBeautiful stylistic graphicsA production team clearly behind this gameCons A few graphical issues (walking on water namely) Could do with high rewards for some of the more difficult requests (I get paid more to make storage boxes than I do making a whole bridge?),My Time At Portia,1,
3647,"2018-08-27",0,0,133,1,1,"After almost 100 in game hours I finally decided it's time to write a proper review.Let's start with seemingly unavoidable comparison to Stardew Valley. Stardew Valley offers a lot of activities but its main focus lies with farming. In My Time At Portia farming is really bare bones and the game is centered around crafting. While Stardew Valley feels like more polish and complete game My Time At Portia is way more ambitious project that is on the right track to be the best game in the genre.Great stuff NPCs. Pretty much all characters are great. They are unique both in design and personality they have different tastes preferences behaviors and routines. Not all of their lines are voiced yet and some characters have more related content than others (it is early access after all) but they make Portia feel alive. Interacting with NPCs. Talking giving gifts dating (not only romantically) playing doing quests marrying even cheating it's all there. And not only that. Sometimes NPCs take a little bit of initiative which is refreshing. And with new content on the way (NPCs asking you for date and ability to have babies) it looks like My Time At Portia is doing something that no other game was able to fully accomplish.Crafting system. I love it. The Assembly Station is really fun to work with. It's cool to see your invention partially done ).Help the city and help yourself. Main quests are mostly related to building/fixing things around Portia and finishing those will allow you to discover new places get new resources or... create fast travel system. Variety of activities. Crafting fishing mining cutting trees cooking hunting fighting going through dungeons farming taking care of your animals... Some are more fun than others but since it's early access hopefully it will change.Festivals. Unique fun and creative. I wish there were two per month. Neat character creator.Good leveling system. Although some perks are currently nearly useless. Responsive developers and regular updates with new content. Some criticism I don't agree with Rushing and grinding. I really don't see what's the issue. Every game in ""sorta farm life"" genre is grindy and as for the rush... For me this game has perfect pace because it's under your control. Most of main quests do not have time limit so you can focus on getting better equipment upgrading your house and machines gathering resources and generally getting more familiar with the game rather than pushing through every single objective as soon as possible. NPC quests usually do have time limit but with few dishonorable exceptions it's usually at least few days so enough to complete it.Bad stuff Some quests.So... you're telling me I have few days to distribute MEDICINE to people but only one day to find the owner of missing documents which I found around 10 P.M.? Okaaay... Cooking. Cooking is atrocious. I hate it. I only use it for character related quests never for my own benefit because it's just too frustrating and pretty much requires that you sit with open wikipedia which is a failure of game design. Frustrating boring and way too expensive to go with ""trial and error"" way (especially early in the game when some ingredients are either pricey or very rare).Farming. Using fertilizer is a nightmare. Crafting fertilizer is a nightmare since it requires mucus which is pretty rare and used by other more important recipes. Buying fertilizer is way too expensive. That renders fertilizer completely useless and without it the whole farming is basically plant the seed and wait.Worth mentioning There are also bugs but this is an early access game and there aren't that many so I don't think it's fair to make big deal about it (since there are plenty fully released games with much more problems). The optimization is not the best it runs fine on my PC but some players experienced performance issues. Developers acknowledged this though and are constantly working on improving this aspect. Conclusion.My Time At Portia is already an amazing game with huge potential dedicated community and responsive developers. I can fully recommend it in current state and can't wait to see how much this game will change until final release.",My Time At Portia,1,
3648,"2019-01-27",2,65,107,0,1,"This is by far the best Harvest Moon esqe game I've ever played. Now let me tell you about My Time At Portia it's set in a post apocalyptic world The world as we know it has ended technology has been lost and you're a new builder in town. A worn down shack has been left for you by your father who you haven't heard from in years. And thus your new life starts!Now it's more builder related than farmer related but you CAN have a farm. You can have crops and raise animals and horses etc but the main premise is you craft stuff that the town is needed. And as the story continues you help recover lost technology you BUILD lost technology you add features to the town and expand it beyond its mere excistance. Now that's the story but what makes this game so special? what makes it stand out?For me it's the small details that made me fall in love it has so many small features that I never even knew I really needed in a Harvest Moon lookalike game. (We need a name for these beyond simulators and crafting games).It's the fact I can decorate my house I can put up bookshelves and tables down. And actually put stuff in them! On them! You can place a plain table and almost anything can be placed on it. By clicking E when near furniture you open up their ""menus"" and you see how many slots they have. A table could have one or two or four depending on which one you're dealing with. And things that can't be placed on it from your inventory will be greyed out. I decorated my kitchen with food on the tables and a cauldron in the corner. It has a pretty extensive relationship system where you go from stranger to associate to buddy to friend to close friend to more. You have lovers and boyfriends/girlfriends and wives and husbands! And there is a real reason to nuture these relationships! Getting to certain relationships marks will unlock quests and cutscenes and some gives passives buffs. (like 50 more hp or 25% discount at their store). And there are multiple ways to level these up! If you don't care about this and only care about harvesting and crafting.. then what? what if you're the hermit that grumbles at people and don't want to socialize but make an apparence on town festivals? Well guess what.. Not only does most festivals give you +relations with everyone in town if you say... participate in a snowball fight with x members of town you'll get a boost for every one of those people. And as a builder you accept jobs and do delievers there is a board you can take them from. There are jobs from town people that will give relations to them + exp + gold and there are jobs for guild that gives larger amount of exp and gold but no reputaton. Now I cannot stress this enough.. this game has an actual story.AN. ACTUAL. STORY! This is new for me Stardew Valley which was my old big love didn't feature a very big story. You could restore this building or help grow a store and see weird magical creatures but there weren't really a STORY there. Here there is.Not only is there an actual main story of the game there are bad guys enemies to be defeated improvements to be made. There are crime and criminals to hunt down and apprehend (albeit slightly innocent criminals since it's mostly a PG13 friendly game. (example one of the crimes was someone burning down a building when we found out who did it they said they thought the building would hurt the town)).Not only do we have the main story there are individual story arcs some bigger than others. Most of these revolves around the characters you can marry but they all have some story you can discover without marrying (and divorcing) over and over again. I cannot tell you how amazing it was to get to know these characters with cut scenes and voice acting. I fell completely in love. I picked my husband with care I was sitting there considering two options and one of them asked ME to be his girlfriend. I was so shocked they could ask ME? I didnt have to do the entire job? Alright.I tried him out and didn't like it so I broke up with him and married the other.I felt like I was in the middle of a romance novel or something. Now what else can I say to make you play this The developers are great and they're involved in the community. They're a fairly fresh company (tho this isn't their first game) and they're still learning. Recently they had a slight drama with voice actors and people claiming they weren't paid. I hadn't heard anything about it until I read a post they'd published on the matter where they explained the drama the mistake and the misunderstanding and stated what they where doing to rectify the situation. I loved this it was very plain and honest unlike some companies that if they even make a statement just make some plain garbel about how mistakes where made and it will be rectified. I got told WHAT happened how it happened and what the plan was to fix it. And THAT kind of upfront honesty is what we need in this buisness. So yes like harvest moon?like stardew valley?Buy this game. It's amazing.",My Time At Portia,1,
3649,"2019-02-05",3,127,8,1,1,Wow! I have been wanting a good Medieval town builder for a while! I love Banished big fan of Age of Empires got heavy into Dawn of Discovery adore the Stronghold games and the Total War series... But none of those really hit the craving I've had lately. Either there's too much combat or the elemental maintenance is too high and I just kinda wanna... play.... Medieval Cities Skylines.This has a chill balance! Definitely a game I can relax to however it's challenging enough to where I don't feel as though I've exhausted all of my building options.This Foundation is what I've been craving!!! Love it so much!!!Spoilers? _______________________________________________Pros You don't have to micromanage every person they live their own lives you simply govern. The grid free building system is fluid aesthetically pleasing and keeps things interesting.(Even if I play the same map choosing the same starting location my town could turn out entirely different.) There's a slight Settlers of Catan vibe when you start fresh A new map is loaded and you have to select a property that suits you. This comes down to which resources you value on your starting plot do you want to be by water etc. A lot of strategy can go into where you place your town center. Or not! You can just go for it and see what happens! Replayability. Cute art style. Great graphics which run very smoothly on my PC. For early access I've played two 4 hour sessions and haven't felt any bugs. So that's pretty impressive! You can kind of make whatever you want by using monuments! Screenshot fun time! DPersonal Preference It would be cool if maps were randomly generated with/without select preferences forest density hills mountains water etc. This would allow for further replayability but definitely isn't required!!! Multiplayer would be fun. My wife and I have been playing side by side and comparing our little settlements but it would be cool if we could have a trade route between one another or something! However if multiplayer never came to Foundation that would be just fine!,Foundation,1,
3650,"2019-02-06",3,60,1,1,1,Is it a good game? Yes.Is it a fun game? Yes.Did the devs put 30 euros of work into it? Yes.However is the gameplay worth 30 euros? Arguably not.This game is like The Settlers 7 but without many of the constrictions that game offered. On the other hand there isn't much to do after a couple of hours in. You just build a town and... That's about it.I'll recommend the game for the work the devs put in because it's really pretty and well made but that's all I can say about it. Maybe if it was like 10 or 15 euros then I'd find the price more reasonable.,Foundation,1,

3652,"2019-02-01",3,175,107,1,1,I've owned this game since Kickstarter played all the alphas. It's fantastic and keeps getting better. We were building big cities from the get go and I can't wait to see what this new version has in store. Needless to say I heartily recommend the game! You can see my latest playthrough including a quickstart tutorial here https //www.youtube.com/playlist?list PLRm_zpPOcTPsbgbgr4BEark6lqBLwxncMAdding to this. I recommend playing without any balance mods for now they prevent the tutorial quests from running and these give you lots of free land which really speeds up the beginning of the game. The trader issue on the new Valley map has been fixed so a bridge is no longer needed in order to start trading. Devs are very responsive to bugs as they have been since the Kickstarter.,Foundation,1,
3653,"2019-02-03",0,0,5,1,1,After 5 hours of play time so far I'm impressed and pretty optimistic this game is going to turn into a good city builder.I've seen a number of negative reviews that named no proper tutorial and an unintuitive interface as their reason to vote negative. I agree that at this time it's not always very clear what you have to do and where you find certain things in user interface but most things really only take a little longer to figure out than you're used to. There's definatly room for improvement here but in my opinion it's absolutely no deal breaker.The presentation of the game is great. Graphics and art style are very nice to look and the music and ambient sounds create a very nice and relaxed athmosphere while you work on your town.The more free form and grid less approach to building is refreshing and lets you create towns that seem like they've naturally grown. Very pleasing to the eye not having to align everything and having a lot more control of what you want to build wherever.I really like the mix of building and managing your town and people and all of the base features that are important to a game seem to be well thought out and not too shallow though I do hope to see other layers of complexity for existing features added.As many people mentioned it definatly borrows from some of the best and most popular city builder games like Anno Cities Skylines Banished The Settlers and I'd say they dev team picked and chose pretty well which features from all of these games would fit well with their own flavour of builder.In the spectrum of Early Access releases I'd fore sure count this among the better ones. If I'd had to rate my Early Access experience with this game after 5 hours I'd say it's a somewhere around a 7.5 or 8.Overall thumbs up from me!,Foundation,1,
3654,"2019-02-04",9,91,12,1,1,"It's been my experience that reviews on Steam are pretty harsh. Don't listen to the detractors on this project. ""Foundation"" is at the very early stages as an Early Access game. And IMO it's already on course to being one of the greats. Think ""Banished"" but many steps beyond. Yes there's a lot of work that needs to be done. But hey... it's ""Early Access"". Right?I'll say it a little more clearly for those in the back of the room... ER LEE AX SESS!!! See that big blue box at the top? The one that states loudly ""Early Access Game""? It means something!Chill people! ""Foundation"" needs to be judged not on its completeness but by its state and potential. Already it's in great shape (all things considered). I've played it for a few hours and its crashed on me a few times. I'm willing to forgive those crashes. That being said it's game play and strategy its economy and the way it all works together (at least from what I've learned from it) are really well done well thought out... and what's more... addicting!! There's a few issues with the UI I'd like to see reconsidered. But these are minor. I really like the way you can paint your zones and watch your sims go to work. As they walk in the fields they create their own roads and this helps shape how your little village will grow. It adds a nice ""natural ness"" to the way your city will evolve. Again very well thought out and fun to watch.If you have no issue with branching out and trying an Early Access game and particularly if you like ""Banished"" I would highly recommend ""Foundation"". I for one am excited to be a part of its development and look forward to the adventure of watching it mature.If you're expecting a fully polished game with no flaws. Move on... please. Those working this project don't need your bad reviews. And I mean all of this with respect and sincerity. Some people just aren't there when it comes to branching out in the EA direction. And that's perfectly fine. Just please don't pay money for this game and then write a review as if it were ready for your PS4 console. It's not.

Right now we got a (promising) barebones game and only the dev's vision for 30 want to experience varied and longer gameplay. You can build and expand the basic stuff but there is nothing to do anymore besides that. Entertaining for less hours than I have fingers on my hand. expect any kind of combat. This is a casual city builder need cloud saving. want a proper tutorialRight now I have refunded the game as it does not bring me enough value and I do not feel the need to test and shape the game for the amount of money asked.

3657,"2019-02-02",10,197,2,1,0,Underwhelming at the moment there's just not that much to do. It seems fun in its premise though.It has some dangerous bugs (upgrading the church? No one can go into it until it is finished and they will keep trying to go. All day long. Making them starve.) and weird problems (monuments often have a sizeable part underground). Walls are free to build which seems... too easy?

3663,"2018-05-23",13,106,12,1,1,As a big fan of Guitar Hero and as a person interested in music I was certainly excited when I first saw a gameplay video of this game. I bought the HTC Vive just a few days before Beat Saber was released and tried a few other games but as soon as this game was released playing the Vive has been the same as playing Beat Saber.The game is really simple. In a good way. I ve had many friends over and I just pop the Vive over their head start the game and just let them have it. All of them get what they have to do immediately. All of them sound a little anxious feel a bit ashamed that they miss a block or two but a couple of seconds later they re completely immersed in the game. As soon as the song is over they quietly ask Can I have another go? .For me this game quickly became a huge motivation. I want to be better I want to hit those global leaderboards. It s no casual gaming anymore. I m putting on shorts prepare a water bottle and play all out until I m spent lying panting on the floor. Even if I don t hit those leaderboards at least I ll be as fit as Arnold Schwarzenegger was in his golden days by the end of the summer. And this is the first time in forever that I ve been this motivated by a game.Even though the songs are far from the kind of music that I listen to I cannot help but walk around having the melodies in my head constantly. Some songs I play because I like the music others I play because the level is just really fun to play. And some because both of those reasons. In general the music and levels are really well done and I m really looking forward to more songs and user made content. I m hoping the genres will be a bit more diverse later on but I m really impressed with how good these first songs are.I do have a couple of suggestions to improve the game though I would like it if I could practice a certain part of a certain song much like you could in Guitar Hero so you can really hone your skills. Now your only chance to practice and study the song is to turn on the No Energy mode and play without the risk of failing the level. If the part you re having trouble with is 1 minute and 30 seconds in it s kind of frustrating to play through the song over and over again and not get a chance to really practice the hard part before you have to restart the song again. So a training mode where maybe you could even slow down the speed or something to really perfect your gameplay would be awesome. The other thing that has been bothering me are the blocks that have no arrow but a point on them. Everyone who s tried the game me included has tried to stab these blocks the first time they ve encountered them. It took a couple of tries before I realized that they were a Swing however you want block. I think it would be better if these blocks had no marking at all. That would be more clear as to what you re supposed to do with them.Also I would like to look as cool as I feel when playing. I don t. I look stupid. Like I m randomly waving my hands around uncontrollably. Can you make me look like a jedi master instead? I would appreciate that.Thanks for one of the best gaming experiences I ve had in ages!,Beat Saber,1,

3683,"2018-07-14",12,420,245,0,1,I was never interested in farming games. I ve never played a Harvest Moon game or an Animal Crossing game and never had any interest in them. The closest thing to a farming game I ve ever played was Minecraft. I definitely would have never tried Stardew Valley if I wasn t an achievement hunter and it didn t have achievements. But now I see what all the hype was about.Stardew Valley is a game that is very easy to lose oneself into. There are many elements of the game that feel intimately relatable to real life especially the game s premise you re stuck at a soul crushing corporate office job when your grandfather dies leaving you an envelope telling you to open it only when you ve reached your absolute limit and need something new. After a particularly bad day at work you finally decide to open the envelope and find a deed to your grandfather s farm on a far off island so you take the plunge and decide to move there. It is a very strong analogy to the game itself where you the player are seeking escapism from your daily life and decide to take the plunge into this game not knowing what else to expect.In Stardew Valley you will find your new home upon a sizable but absolutely trashed plot of land. As the days go by you can clean up the land and discover hundreds of ways to make a profit with what you ve been given from buying seeds and planting crops to raising animals to fishing (by means of a surprisingly pleasant and addictive quicktime event) to foraging for wild food and even to exploring a few combat centric Zelda style dungeons. But you re not making money for its own sake there are dozens of mysterious secrets scattered about the land each with significant and game changing rewards at the end and you need to raise the money and resources to investigate them all. The game experience is going to be totally different for everybody depending on what game elements you are inspired to pursue first. Although you ll assuredly be looking at a wiki in due time it is deeply satisfying to go in blind and piece things together yourself for as long as you can.Years consist of four months each month being 28 day season. Some gameplay mechanics change with the seasons particularly that certain crops only grow in certain seasons and (almost) no crops grow in winter so you ll have to carefully consider what seeds to plant and when. Each day lasts about five minutes and you ve got to make sure you re back in your house by 2AM or else you ll pass out and lose some money. The biggest way the game hooks you is the fact that your progress is only saved at the start of a day so if you re eager to wake up in the morning and harvest your crops it won t mean anything unless you play the whole day through. A vicious cycle! I clocked 120 hours of this game in the first 2 weeks of playing. That s how bad it is.Another one of the game s strengths is the cozy little community you live beside with a population of about 25 people. The game does a wonderful job of making each character feel like their own entity with their own daily routines and backstories and motivations. You ll really get to know and love them. You can give gifts to characters to increase friendship level with them unlocking character development cutscenes and important rewards. You can even date some of them (you can have 6 boyfriends and 6 girlfriends at once if you want no joke relationships are gender indiscriminate) and then marry the character of your choice. The social aspect is sometimes a bit too real you ll feel the pain of rejection all too often but that makes the successful relationships all the more heartwarming.As for complaints surprisingly the game has some strange and baffling bugs most of which are visual (like ice skating horses) but some which affect gameplay and a few known save corruption bugs. I also felt consistently uncomfortable with the controls. If you're using the mouse your cursor needs to always be in proximity of your character or else you'll only aim at the tile in front of you making it very easy to abruptly turn the wrong direction while working. And if you accidentally click the wrong tile your character will turn to face it changing the default direction you aim compounding the problem. It can be infuriating especially if it causes you to accidentally destroy crops. Also I don't like how you can only talk to NPCs if you have a tool selected and how you'll use a consumable item at the same time as opening a door if you have one selected. The controls could definitely use some additional polish. Then there are the inventory controls. If you click on an inventory item you pick it up and you can drop it in a different inventory slot. If you click on an inventory item with a storage box open you will immediately transfer the item into (or out of) the box. Thus it is impossible to organize the inventory with a storage box open. If you click on an inventory item while in a shop you immediately sell the item with no confirmation. I can't tell you the amount of times I purchased 200 seeds then immediately sold them again just because I tried to pick them up and put them in a different slot.Also I can t help but feel the game should have even more content than it already does perhaps more dungeons a bigger map and the ability to run more than one farm. But (as of this writing) the game is still in active development including a co op multiplayer patch in the works and a lively modding community.I give this game an 8/10. A wonderful example of what all those crappy Farmville mobile games would be like if they were actually balanced around gameplay and not milking the player with microtansactions and daily login bonuses. Despite some stupidly distracting bugs and annoying controls it s some simply wonderful escapism and made me finally see the appeal in a farming game. It does get stale in time but not before offering a huge amount of joy. For achievement hunting it ll easily take about 200 hours especially blind but if you re like me you ll have it over with in a month or two. A huge thumbs up.,Stardew Valley,1,

Most quests are fetching quest with one really good ""quest"" and one decent quest. The Community center is by far the most fun quest but it is a more fetching quest but it takes longer due to the fact that you have to work for most of the things or wait for certain events but it feels rewarding to watch an abandoned building become a rather beautiful homey edifice after you complete ""The Community center"" quest the game feels like it's lacking content.

Their Stories Romantic Interests Comments and just ingame chatter is amusing and (in terms of their Stories) extremely captivating.

At first I didn't bother to play it because of my other games II was commited to but when played you cant seem to stop. The character's storyline immerses you into a world of your own. You are able to talk and chat with the town residents as well as earn money through professions such as farming mining or fishing. Trust me because this game will take 50 plus hours away from your life! It is very addicting! I will give this a 10/10 for an immersive gameplay! Zinguin,Stardew Valley,1,
3718,"2016-03-25",0,0,70,0,1,What can I say? As nostalgic as a drunk aunt who reminds you she loves you As soothing as your favorite young adult book but all the references make sense Its a musty attic full of the pleasures and traumas of growing up under a safety blanket of dust and cardboardFrom the opening music which would resemble the best 16 bit console themes except for the judicious application of whammy bar you know you are in for a classic experience that escapes the hazy dreamscape of Nintendo and incorporates a bit of the home life from which you were trying to escape. Dare I say this is Harvest Moon for adults who know better? Is this Thanksgiving dinner with the extended family after your sophomore year at college? Is it catching up with your high school sweetheart over coffee and laughing over a distant now but shared past but with no regrets?

3720,"2018-10-16",2,118,257,0,1,"TL DR A fantastic game worthy of whether you buy it on sale or not. I could've paid $60 for it and I still would be happy with my experience. The developer (ConcernedApe) should be proud of the work he's done here it's a fantastically enjoyable piece of art.To start I played this game cooperatively with my girlfriend from the start to the end. As a side note if you're going to play with a friend from the start you want to enable extra cabins. The extra cabins allow 1 extra player to join you. You can start without cabins and build them super cheaply but if you're wanting to jump right into it you'll next the extra.I'm a very seasoned gamer having played video games since the original NES. It wasn't too terrible for me to the get the hang out it right out of the box I suggest enabling ""always on targeting marker"" in the options as it will greatly help with properly aiming. Also make sure you're not standing on the tile you wish to interact with such as tilling land. My GF is not a seasoned gamer this was her second game she's played on PC utilizing a mouse and keyboard. I had her enable the aiming marker as well and she had a relatively easy time figuring out what she was doing for the most part.There is a ton of stuff to do in this game and you can't go wrong with any of them.Farming is easily the most profitable and you don't even need to worry about which crops are the best cash crops. It's very appealing to try to have a crop of each type due to the benefit of cooked food as well as quests that require various crops. If you only grow one crop you'll missing out on other aspects of the game.Fishing is a bit rough and continues to be a bit rough throughout the game. Some of the fish are a pain to catch and remain a pain to catch but it's because it costs very little to fish and can yield large payouts should you get good at the fishing mini game. Crabpots are a great way to raise fishing and acquire 'fish' for other endeavors and easy money.Mining &amp Combat these two are together because they go hand in hand. You go to the mines and later elsewhere and in the process of mining for ore you encounter monsters. You don't become an almighty god amongst mortals in this game you need to rely on placement timing and farming/cooking to help you have the easiest experience especially once you're done with ""the mines"". Armor is your boots and buffs from food. Your weapons are a melee weapon and ranged weapon I've never used the ranged weapon in combat. Food restores energy and heals you your crops and livestock can provide better 'food' that is actually cooked that provides buffs.Villagers are an important part of this game and you want to work on becoming friends with them. There's a calender in town square next to a job board keep track of birthdays find out what people like and given them those gifts. Doing so leads to extra content within the game. It's completely worth it.Foraging is actually beneficial and provides a source of income food and goods. You use your hoe on 'worm tiles' and you receive items typically for the museum. I suggest doing this as it can give you a leg up on making money and give you access to things that you couldn't get yet.All in all I'd say I love this game. My girlfriend loves this game. It's been an enjoyable experience for a seasoned gamer and someone new to gaming. They did it right with this one and deserve all the praise they get. If you can play with one extra person farm life will be exceptionally easier. For each extra person the more specialized you can get. Fishing is always relevant mining is always as well. Farming is only useful as long as you can grow crops and have money for the seeds (or get a seed maker). With two people we were able to get a large portion of the content done we're just down to getting the last pieces of 'end game gear' and wrapping up maxxing out friendships.A few tips if you do decide to get into it.Enable always on targeting marker.Don't stand on the tile you're tilling.If you have nothing better to do go mining.Work on friendships.Work on the community center.Grow all the varied crops.Don't be afraid of the wiki crops were my usual pages.Play with a friend if you can. Make a friend to play this with if you don't have one.All options are valid.Upgrade the watering can first (gold if you can)Upgrade the hoe next (gold too but not as important as watering can)Don't worry about buying too much equipment for the mines just bring food for healing/energy.The upgraded backpack is SO worth it especially while mining.Don't concern yourself too much with min maxing it doesn't really matter.Be patient take your time.If you're going to the mines try to make 5 levels each time you go the elevator saves progress every 5.Gather all of your crops no later than the 28th (they all day next season except some.)All crops die in winter.Store at least a couple of everyone. I kept the highest tier I could get sold the rest.Use winter for mining and reorganizing (most useful for solo or duo play.)Most of all have fun and relax. Don't stress too much.There's tons more tips but this is a review. PIt's a great game worth every dollar. I don't regret buying this full price. The devs deserve it and I hope they can make another great game like this. Sci fi next time hopefully!",Stardew Valley,1,

This is a very addicting game I've sunk in many hours so far and I won't be stopping any time soon.I have not found anything I dislike about this game so far. The longer you play the more stuff you unlock which is good as you cannot get everything done and completed within the first few years.I highly recommend this to anyone who played any of the Harvest Moon series you won't be disappointed.

3752,"2016-02-28",193,1983,764,0,1,"This is a game that I have been looking forward to for at least 2 and a half years. I have wanted to have a game on the PC that had the elements of harvest moon (for the little bit I played of it) Animal crossing (&lt 3) and Rune factory. I was super excited when I was approached by Leth (publishing manager at Chucklefish) at the beginning of December to help him and ConcernedApe (developer of the game) with bug testing and QA. 400+ hours later (off steam and on steam) I still love the game. Farming. The farming is fantastic. It is to me one of the main elements of the game and it's just a joy. Being able to design your farm any way you want it... yes please. Planning out what to buy every season where to plant them on top of the thrill of when you can harvest and reap on the gold... it's so enjoyable and addictive. Fishing. The fishing is outstanding. From playing WoW and Runescape.. or any game with fishing the fishing in Stardew Valley is so much fun. At first the fishing is challenging but as you progress your skill you become a pro in no time.Mining and combat. Mining and combat is incredible. Going deeper into the mines can be tough but if you're prepared with your food and weapon in hand you can fend off the creatures and get your sweet ore/minerals/gems that you want to bring back to your house and possibly hoard. (Hi I'm Bexy and i'm a hoarder.) Social. Social interactions are great. Being able to become friends with the people in the town and eventually being able to get into relationships with people and having a family with them.. what's not to like about that? And what's great is that it gives great replayability because you can have different saves with different spouses! The backstory for each of the characters too is so in depth and well thought out you will be silly if you don't shed a tear maybe once or twice. Main story. The actual main story is well rewarding and once you ""complete"" it you can still continue on your adventures and farming life with no problems hell you might even discover new things afterwards I sure as hell did! Yes I was a tester for the game. Yes I have played for ridiculous amounts of hours. It may feel like i'm being a bit overzealous with this. However you have to remember I was a tester. I tested the crap out of every aspect with this game even though there were massive game breaking bugs errors glitches crashes. I still love this game. I reported many a bug and ConcernedApe was quick to fix them. And that's the thing not only is the game amazing the developer is too. ConcernedApe works around the clock to make sure that bugs are fixed in quick time in order for us to have an amazing experience with this game. And that's true. The experience that you have with this game IS amazing. Minutes playing turn into hours. Hours turn into ""oh no it's time to sleep"".You will forget about time. You will forget about sleep. You will forget that dinner was about 5 hours ago but you couldn't' remember because you were too busy trying to fight off 12 bats that were clobbering you inside the mines while trying to gather that 1 diamond waaaaay in the back. So yes I without a shadow of a doubt 150% recommend this game to anyone that wants to ""escape"" for days on end with what I am classifying as my #1 Game of 2016.",Stardew Valley,1,

Stardew Valley manages to capture the heartwarming feeling of the old Harvest Moon games just fine and comes with all their pro's and gets rid of some of the flaws.The soundtrack of this game is awesome and the graphics fit the overall theme plus the character sprites are top notch )The controls can be a little unprecise and the menues tedious to navigate but there is no reason to rush yourself in this game it is no brain surgery so it is not too bad.

3801,"2018-02-22",2,1,640,0,1,A gripping speculative horror scifi tale both relatable and poignant of a modern day wage slave's dying dream. In their final moments as they suffer from a lethal yet preventable malady they cannot afford to have treated they envision a reality in which they escape the shackles of their corporate servitude. They move to a pictureqsue and bountiful valley full of friendly and open minded locals and through fair and honest toil they are able to earn an honest living organically growing only the skills they wish to pursue. Eventually they are able to buy expensive house extensions get married have children and secure a comfortable retirement as well as the approval of their extended family.Past a certain point the veil falls away. The player character learns they are not in paradise but a kind of purgatory. For the denizens of the valley time does not seem to pass spring summer autumn winter goes by birthdays are celebrated but no one ages sickens dies. Subtle hints of mysterious wondrous and sinister powers show over the course of gameplay manifestations of the reality the player character hoped to leave behind linger in their subconscious inescapable even past the great and inevitable barrier of Death.I loved Harvest Moon for the SNES and this game is a lot like that. Try it with mods!,Stardew Valley,1,
3802,"2016-03-22",0,0,144,0,1,I feel by this point I have fully and completely did absolutely everything I could possibly do. So I am going write out this review fully again and ever come back to it. Stardew valley if you need a few games to make reference to from games I've played is a lot like Animal Crossing and also Farmville and yes Minecraft too. Yes.Its Farmville in that you have an actual farm in which you plant things and you can have animals the animals need fed and they produce stuff for you and you control the structure of the farm and you are the driving force to making everything work but its not a mobile game so there are no such things as 'speeding up production' which in turn means no microtransactions but that really goes without saying.Its like Animal Crossing in that also have a house that you can upgrade for additional rooms (a total of 4 upgrades) Furthermore the game has a social aspect to it like Animal Crossing in that you can (and are heavily encouraged) to make friends with the various villagers and if you do they will give you things like materials and recipes to further increase your career as the villages first Gordon Ramsey. You can even marry the villagers if you so choose but I would refer to the wiki if you are going to do that because the various cutscenes are far too random for each one.Its like Minecraft because its how I handle the game.Its as fun as you want it to be in the end and it will only be as fun as you put into it. This game could ideally go on forever but it won't because its too repetitive and that is only as unfortunate as your hopes wish for it to be.You farm and produce an awful lot of money quickly you ger married you can get a horse and organize your farm however you like you can mine for stuff which later becomes a place where you can slay stuff which feels kinda stapled on.The social aspect is actually more fleshed out than you think from this review but it mostly only serves to make the world seem less lonely and really makes me just want to talk to an actual human being which we will be able to do come January when Muliplayer is expected to a thing.The Marriage thing gives you a bunch of archetypical folks to choose from but they're not as they appear. Abigail is the best example of this and is into the occult which is a thing that actually bothered me. Therefore I can with certainty that they did pretty good with the social aspect.Overall its a 8/10 for me but keep in mind that this score will be different for you.,Stardew Valley,1,

This game has so much freedom that I've spent hours having simple fun out of pointless tasks. If you're a fan of the Harvest Moon franchise or even just of the farm/tending scene I totally recommend this game.,Stardew Valley,1,

Characters are very in depth with different scenes and overall feelings the world is very in depth with good soundtrack and different secrets and there is a lot of replayability ecpecially with the release of different farmlands. The best part I think is that I payed $15 for over 200 hours of content (from a personal standpoint of course. I might just have a problem). I care for the characters which is something I really value in games generally and I have actually been brought to tears at times.

3831,"2017-12-26",0,0,54,0,1,Product received for free. Stardew Valley..... With the very short amount of time spent pay this game (5 hours) I am impressed. With starting the game not have read any reviews or watched anything on it I found myself thinking that this game would be like any other typical simulator for farming. I was very Impressed and hooked by the storyline of the game and gameplay being able to do anything I wanted within the small town of Pelican but also making sure everything I was doing was on track. Stardew Valley can be a very confusing and fustrating game at times you may faint of no energy or it being to late at night but it never comes back to the game itself but how you play the game. I highly reccommend this game for those with more time on their hands than others due to how the game depends on time heavily.,Stardew Valley,1,

The characters the mining and combat the fishing and especially the farming. This game is actually quite strategic in the way that you plan out what you will do each day depending on the weather or other factors. It isn't just a playing game it is also a thinking game and it doesn't get enough love for how good it is.,Stardew Valley,1,
3835,"2016-03-02",0,0,192,0,1,"So after the kappa review I did I suppose I might as well do a normal one.Today's game market is flooded with all sorts of games triple A's indies and some of which even made by one person. Sometimes one game shows up outta nowhere and suprises us in the best way possible.Stardew Valley is one of these games. After 4 years of development ConcernedApe (Eric Barone) brought us a near masterpiece. Stardew valley is a farming RPG heavily inspired by Harvest Moon. When I first heard of the game it was only 2 weeks away from release but it only took one glance at it to have me sold on it. The art has been redone completely multiple times over the course of it's development and the pixel art looks great the style's also very reminiscent of the aforementioned Harvest Moon. At the start of the game you inherit your grandfather's farm only to find it in a run down state and it's up to you (as the new owner) to return it to it's former glory. The gameplay is very slow but that's okay since it is meant to be a long term project. This is because you basically live your life in this game as you progress through days months and years. You can farm fish mine cook socialize forage construct craft and more. Stardew Valley has a lot of mechanics some rougher than others but they compliment each other nicely. What I personally didn't like as much was the fishing. I don't know if it's because I'm bad at it but it felt time wasting because of the result in the early stages of levelling your fishing skill due to the lower amounts of money you'd get. Sometimes the controls can feel a little bit lacking but this does not severely handicap your experience. In fact after the first 50 hours (which you will reach oh believe me) you're basically used to it. Stardew Valley has a storyline which you can follow but it's not necessary so you can basically just do whatever you want to do. The game has no ending so you can also keep playing for as long as you'd like (keep in mind that you do want to have some stuff done before year three though...). Now that we got mechanics and controls out of the way I can talk about what I like the most about the game. The NPCs are scattered across the map and at first you'll be urged to seek and meet them all. Most of the NPCs all have their own little backstory personalities movement patterns and dialogue of which the latter two are also dynamically influenced by conditions as the weather day of the week season and so on. You can befriend these NPCs by well err.. by doing what you'd do in real life of course! Giving them gifts every two days of the week! Barging into their homes and hand them a bat's wing only to leave as fast as you entered to leave them in confusion. Unless you give them stuff they actually *like*. As you progress in your relationships with these NPCs you'll collect small scraps of their backstory and eventually they will send you stuff (yay). Keep in mind that it is thus useful to improve your relationship with certain NPCs first who fit your playstyle as their gifts can sometimes prove quite useful. Some of these NPCs are also *bachelors* which means that if you increase your relationship to a level high enough you will be able to marry them. Your spouse will then move into your home and they will provide you with dialogue items or they will even do chores for you daily. The soundtrack was also redone and is quite subtle most of the times which fits the theme. My favorite track is in all honesty ""Marimba of the frozen bone"". Stardew valley has a relaxing theme and it is a great game to just sink lots of time into. I wouldn't recommend it if you have better stuff to do as that stuff will NOT get done. In a world with an increasing indie game market Stardew Valley stands out as one of these special accomplishments and it damn deserves to. 9.5/10.I'm suprised the game allowed me the time to write this instead of making me play it.",Stardew Valley,1,

3857,"2016-08-18",0,0,15,0,1,Since some of you people don't like to read lots of text the TL DR is at the bottom.I'm going to try to cover every aspect of the game but I'm sure I'll miss something so forgive me.Farming The actual Agricultural aspect of this game is great. You have to buy seeds plant them water them manually or with sprinklers once you can build them. It's simple and I personally thing that's a good thing. Everything has a different buying and selling price and you can craft different meals with different fruits/vegetables. You also have various animals and all of them serve different purposes that make you money. You have to make sure they are fed and happy and they will give you what you need. That being said the farming and animal work can get a little bit repetetive especially if you don't get sprinklers then you have to manually water every plant every day. There are things you can do to help this but you still have to spend alot of time doing the same thing over and over.Characters All of the characters in the game are done very well. Each of them have their likes and dislikes in terms of what you can give them. You can marry characters if they like you enough. All of them have different traits and it feels like they're all well put together characters not just crappy shallow NPC's that are there to sell you stuff like seeds or house upgrades. I actually liked and disliked them which was surprising.Mining I haven't gotten to much into mining but so far it seems entertaining. You mine to get materials to build things and you can get artifacts to give the Gunther at the Archaeology Center. There are creatues down there to attack you so you also have a little bit of combat mixed in there which is a nice touch.Miscellaneous There are other things in the game that are nice for instance the annual Town Fair where you have to bring some of your best items the desert that you have to repair the bus to get to the Community Center which you can help rebuild and your dead Grandfather (Who you inherit the farm from) comes at the beginning of your third year and rates you on how you've done in the first 2 years after that it's basically endless.TL DR I would definitely have to recommend this game due to the great characters the good farming mechanics the Mining the various moments along the way and the $15 Price. The only negatives are that the Farming can get repetetive and 2 years isn't really enough to time to get stuff done for the rating you get.,Stardew Valley,1,

3874,"2018-11-28",5,112,278,0,1,"After playing for just a couple hours I already couldn't even imagine going back to FS17. 80 hours later farming still feels better than it ever did before. Good job Giants DAlmost every single aspect of the game has been improved from FS17 in some way. Most notably item handling Moving things by hand is no longer frustrating! Things no longer fly out of your hand whenever you touch anything no Herculean strength to flip tractors with a piece of wood and able to rotate items in hand. Looking forward to conventional balers at this point. vehicle handling greatly improved steering feels much more realistic (using keyboard) you can feel you're driving a several ton piece of machinery suspension and ground response better than ever vehicle maintenance vehicles no longer have daily maintenance fee instead they have wear and tear that you have to fix for a small fee (similar to what Seasons mod did in FS17) resulting in massive decrease in passive running cost for the farm (idle vehicles don't cost you) land management you no longer own entire map except the fields land/field expansion feels more natural with having to buy the land. Buy a forest cut down the trees and turn it into farmland! buildings finally able to build up your own farm other than just adding a couple sheds although placing stuff on anything but a very flat ground can cause issues. Upcoming terraforming feature will fix that potentially. Also choice of buildings in base game is limited but I'm sure modding community fill flood the game with dozens of new items soon. field management new lime and weeds mechanics greatly expanding on the ""fertilize 3 times"" approach from FS17 more stuff to do between sowing and harvesting phases new stuff cotton horses sugarcane (for those without FS17 platinum). All with their own mechanics/machinery. More variety of stuff to do even if cotton is pretty bad profit compared to other crops. contracts complete overhaul of missions much less clunky although somewhat buggy at the moment (weeds will overtake NPC fields permanently) animals chickens are finally not useless as eggs will spawn in boxes without having to collect them manually. Placeable animal pens require higher initial investment in livestock similar to buying fields for arable farms. shop better separation of vehicles and implements into categories full 3D preview of machinery and its configuration (""Does this tractor look silly with narrow tires and painted pink? Did that trailer have a hitch on the back or not? I'll just look and see!"") graphics not a massive leap forward but pretty good upgrade overall game feels to be running smoother than FS17 too. Big improvements in lighting and atmospheric visuals you can easily see the difference in the overall image and feel of the game. Beautiful sunsets and night lights ) audio a lot of good enviromental sounds engine sounds stand out much more than in FS17 interface new interface look much cleaner more readable and compactStuff that did not improve (or marginally) AI Workers Almost as derpy as always D seem to miss less parts of a field on angled edges though Logging while the new chainsaw animation is good it seems 'aiming' the cuts is less intuitive pieces of wood can still get glitched after cutting (weird collision box and mass) and still missing any sound when a massive tree falls down. Need that satisfying 'creeeeeak THUD'While the game sure has some issues currently none are too serious or game breaking (as far as I've encoutered).",Farming Simulator 19,1,
3875,"2019-01-20",10,63,1330,0,1,The 'Farming Simulator' franchise is great and I am a big fan of Farming Simulator 17 resulting me in getting this game pre ordered. Now that I have played for around 800 hours and I have noticed this many hours before I just see that the game is just the same as Farming Simulator 17. Yes they have added new cool features such as riding horses but charging 34 99 for a game that is so similar to it's previous version is quite upsetting. The features could also have came in DLC packs that could have saved you money. I wouldn't recommend against Farming Simulator as it's one of my favorite games but I wouldn't say it's worth it's price if you own Farming Simulator 17. I would just stick with that and get this game when there's a good deal.,Farming Simulator 19,1,
3876,"2018-12-23",4,181,12,0,0,"I'm at odds with this game and at the moment I find it difficult whether or not I can recommend it.See the Farming Simulator franchise has meant a lot to me in the past. I met a lot of amazing people indirectly because of this game (through FS UK) and had many great years playing FS13 15 and 17. Once again GIANTS has released their latest game two years later as normal and once again it contains new features some of these have been inspired by popular mods for the prequels and others are new concepts altogether.But my problem with this game is that you quickly realize that underneath its new gameplay elements and new brands and prettier visuals at it's core it's still the same old game as it's been for over ten years now. Unrealistic artifical feeling default maps and clunky arcade like controls that in no way represent farm equipment operation and bring to question the ""simulator"" portion of the title. Games shouldn't have to rely on mod creators to make their game what it is mods should add to the game not be required to get the full effect.GIANTS should take a page out of SCS Software's book. Since the release of Euro Truck Simulator 2 and American Truck Simulator they've continuously updated their flagship titles and released the occasional DLC for revenue instead of an entirely ""new"" game every couple years. This means that mod creators only have to tweak their creations with the new updates instead of completely overhauling them to make them compatible with the new title and loyal fans don't have to re buy the same game continuously. It's getting annoying re purchasing what seems more like a moderately updated version of the same game I bought two years ago.Personally I've grown tired of the franchise and the game that I used to love only bores me now but maybe that's just me. If it was a brand new game entirely maybe I could see myself getting some enjoyment out of it but like I say it feels like the same game it's always been after playing it for just a few moments. So I guess my recommendation would have to be that if you're new to the series go for it. If you've played other FS games and don't find them fun anymore don't bother getting this one because it's unlikely to reignite your interest. And remember that in two years time this same game is going to be re released and you'll once again find yourself starting over.",Farming Simulator 19,1,

3878,"2018-11-19",38,370,75,0,1,I've 356 hours of my life away on FS 17 so naturally I bought this game 4 hours before release and....Its a more polished version of FS 17 with a few new features.And honestly thats great. I simply don't understand the people leaving negative reviews because the core gameplay is the same. What the hell did you expect? zombies? a battle royale mode? Theres only so much you can realisticly do in a game primarly about farming. Anyway...The bad Bugs. Ive encountered a few more since I first wrote a more positive version of this review about 4 hours in. The most glaring right now are a weird floaty physics issue after putting logs in a pickup and removing them a sound hiccup when using the chainsaw and a visual glitch with rain coming through the cab of certain vehicles. Ive also heard about multiplayer connectivity issues but as a single player only person I can't comment. These issues exist as of 11/20/18 Reported issues with connectivity and control bindings not sticking with wheels pedals ect. as of 11/20/18Seasons and the Follow Me mod still haven't been implimented into the base game. Seasons I can kind of understand since people have strong feelings on the mod both for and against so its absence is probably a calculated decision.Sim ers are a fickle bunchVehicle list is a bit small. That's been the case for every farm sim game on launch and has to do with licensing difficulties. Still if you're coming from a heavily modded version of fs17 you'll probably be a bit disapointed. The good While not mind blowing the graphics look a bit crisper and cleaner. In particular vehicle interiours look a lot less 'plastic y' Hard to descibe but compare fs17 and 19 and its noticable. The new start from scratch game mode is a lot of fun and so far works just as advertised.It's probably the only way I'll play the game from now on.The maps while small have alot more detail and are generally more fun to explore than those in base fs17. the devs clearly took insperation from the modding community. Sound improvements. the vehicle engine loops sound better and the rain sound effects are much better. Tweaked vehicle handling. Vehicles in FS17 all felt stiff and toylike. more like driving an RC car than a big piece of machinery. While still not perfect theres a sense of weight behind them now. There is however the physics issue mentioned above with pickups as of 11/20/18I haven't played long enough to mess around with horses the biggest new feature yet but overall Same game still good,Farming Simulator 19,1,
3879,"2018-11-20",5,37,28,0,0,"I have played every Farming Simulator game since 2009 normally bought on release date. This one is the most discouraging game out the gate.This is a day 1 review and I will update it as the game is updated Pro'sLighting is vastly improvedNew crops are always a great additionHorses Good to have another new animal to the game!ConsBugs. Bugs. Bugs. Controller support Before I started the game I had my joystick hoytas plugged in from another game plus my controller. I unplugged it started the game and the game still wanted to use my hoytas. I had to restart the computer to fix this. Others are reporting that they are having issues with X controller or wheel but restarting the computer fixes it. I hate to have to restart my computer when I am switching games. Those days were gone when Windows 3.1 came out.Horses I guess this is the first attempt but very derpy controls. Extremely wonky while you are riding. The hitbox is horribly huge and if you are within what looks like 4 feet of an object it will block you. You can climb trees with a horse. The idea is solid but horrible execution.In Summary If you own FS 17 and still play it I do not recommend this game at this time. If you are new to the series and just want to farm then sure jump on in. If you preordered the game then you don't need my review to make your choice for you.Edit 1 Adding in list of bugs per request. These are not all the bugs I have seen just the ones I can think of while at work.Disappearing missions.Parts of the field ""disappearing"" while harvesting making it to where you cannot see what you have done and what you have not done.Parts of fields not able to be sowed.Chicken egg boxes not filling because something is within 5 miles of it.Placeables everything about them very buggyHelper bots occasionally leaving the field they are on and going 3 fields away. (I LOL everytime.)7.1 sound still doesn't work even after yesterday's patch that supposedly fixed it.Other people report crashes but 25+ hours I haven't had this.However occasionally the sound get's extremely wonky requiring a restart.3 times I have tried to connect to my server but nothing shows on the list.

3881,"2018-12-09",5,52,78,0,1,"I got on board the Farming Simulator series at 17 so I'm not really an old hat at this game series (yet). But for me thus far it's an excellent way to relax and just do something that takes no effort to do. That said I recognize that there are some shortcomings here none of which affect the gameplay enough to shift me from a ""yes"" to a ""no"" but should be acknowledged *FS17 had a map where a player could roll their machines up to dispensers on the farm and have them automatically filled and charged money for the transaction likely more than it would cost to buy pallets and manually fill the tool. FS19 lacking this option for slightly less involved play and modders having to add the functionality afterwards is a slight black mark in my eyes. Obviously most people in this game will want the full experience get a loader load the seed/fertilizer/whatever on a pallet fork dump it into the machine but if the previous title offers a gameplay option to the player I feel that the sequel ought not take it away.*FS17 also had a system by which repeatedly doing jobs for the same farmer visibly accumulated ""friendship points"" for lack of a better term which translated to better pay and a better price for buying land from that farmer. If FS19 retained this there's no indication of it. I believe an incentive to build a reputation with the NPCs is another instance of a gameplay feature that a prior had that its direct sequel ought not to have removed.*Until the player become wealthy enough to be managing many fields at once there is very little to do other than fill contracts for money. When your field is plowed cultivated seeded fertilized and limed all there is to do is stare at it until the next growing stage and then until its finished growing. A minor complaint to be sure but there's a fine line between idle relaxation and boring and early game flirts with it.*This game oozes real world machinery out of every pore. There are an enormous number of options for what to drive what to use to seed cultivate plow spray fertilize and so on. The sheer content volume and variety is impressive and appreciated. And most of it there's no reason to touch except for the fun of it. You have a fast tractor with a front loader attachment that you can get immediately at the start which can be upgraded to have more horsepower for tools than anything short of the most expensive light tractor. The Khun subsoil cultivator/plow is more cost effective than buying the two tools separately and is quite cheap. Buying the most inexpensive fertilizer spreader and a weeder beats everything until you're rich. In essence especially if you're challenging yourself most of the content may as well not even exist. I list this as a downside but I fully acknowledge that even if there is a solution it'd be a headache to figure out so this like the others is a very minor complaint.As of 26 hours in these are the only things I see that could be downsides to this game. Wtih how small they are it seems fair to say that this is a truly excellent experience that I heartily recommend. I'm now looking forward to Farming Simulator 21.",Farming Simulator 19,1,
3882,"2019-01-04",2,37,148,0,0,Farming Simulator 19 Disappointment Edition That should be the title of this game.

Still useless. Handling? Still very very bad. Graphics? Just like FS17 but the system requiremnts are higher (+ Enormous FPS drops). Vehicles and tools? FS17 had more. AI? Very bad/stupid maybe even worse than in 17. Gearbox? Nope. And many many more.So again the only thing that can save this game for me is modding community because developer is too lazy.Ok time for a conclusion DONT BUY THIS GAME! Its a waste of money.

Its a farming game. if there is a barn dammit i should be able to open the door and park / store stuff in it.this is more indepth and while not harder it does require more thought and planning than previous iterations of the franchise. Overall I like it but cant give it 5 stars. A five star game has doors you can open. this is at best a 2 to 3 star game. The maps suck. Really. We have these modes where we start with nothing but really the only decent place to build aanything is the now empty starting plot from the easy mode. the plots of land should allow enough room around them to do your building without impacting the field itself or there should be small plots adjacent to the fields that you can buy that are flat enough to have some fun building your ""dream"" farm that you cant interact with.overall very meh.... its ok.

I know its early access but it feels like the game devs have no idea what they are doing or how to improve the game or work on a bug that has been plagueing the game from the release of early access. You would expect to see improvement week over week especially given the fact they made close to or over half a billion in sales. But that is just not the case. The gameplay feels clunky at best. The graphics nowhere near optimized. And the game is riddled with bugs. And most of these issues have barely improved if at all since early release. Bluehole needs to improve fast or another dev team that knows what the hell they are doing will take up the realistic battle royale mantle.

Especially when PUBG itself are just a bunch of very generic props sticked together ESPECIALLY when PUBG themselves start off as a mod to Arma 3 not original content by any mean. And when anyone create a new game that even in the same gerne as them they go balistic with lawsuit and ""talk show"" to try to shut down the competitor instead of making their game better to compete with the other guys. That's not how you improve gaming as a whole you are holding it back instead.Now on to the game itself its buggy its littered with cheater/hacker its laggy its ran like even though it also look like even on a GTX 1070 of all things. The game basically dont evolve at all since the early access day other than guess what the addition of lootboxes and other ways to monetized the player. Now Im not saying that you cant look for more ways to get more money but when that's your sole focus instead of improving the game in almost anyway its a problem. And to top it all off its back to the dev problem again as they dont care at all about the opinion of the player and instead in face of complain they straight up insult the player calling them ""xenophobic"" because they dont want to play with ppl from like half the earth away who have high ping which ruin their experience with the game and concret evidence/statistic of the high amount of hacker over in China which the dev themselves called out in the past? Stop joking around. It also doesnt help that the hardcore fan of the game are all over the place trying their best to defend the game with things some straight up saying ""I dont care if they are wrong I still think PUBG is the best gamer ever"" which only serve to push the dev into an ""Apple mindset"" where they can do whatever wrong they want and everyone would still worship them anyway. So even though I dont like or play any Battle Royale game im kinda glad that alot of players are catching up to their BS and start moving toward Fortnite instead.So with all that said.

3938,"2017-12-29",0,0,563,0,0,"First off this game was really fun to play with friends and solo. i have put many hours into playing and have had so many great experiences with this game. But this game has MANY problems and downsides that i dont like. With the release of the new desert map i have played less because it is so The loot spawns/drops are god awful and there are not that many small areas to drop unless you go way off to the side of the map. The map is based around sniping which i do like but goodluck playing it withouth a sniper and experience. With the map having big citties/towns it leaves just the good players and the lucky ones to win the first fire fight and the newer players and unlucky players to die withing the first 5 min. The map also has a very annoying glitch in when you first dorp to a location and try to pick up loot it will not go into your inventory also you can not open doors or vault through windows. The old map is realy fun and i enjoy how even and spread out the loot is. There are fun places to drop like school Mili Prision and shelter. and small places to drop near the bottom half of the map. Another big issue with this game is that the lag and frame rate lag is extremely annoying. In the start of the match when every one is dropping in you can land and start rubber banding around trying to find a gun or you can be unlucky and have your parachute glitch out and stand frozen in the middle of the air for 5 10 seconds. Frame rate drops are very common if you dont have a beast computer and wont often be that high I my self have a gtx 1060 and only get 40 50 frames on very low settings. The devs do not do very good optomization updates and i havent experienced any major changes in my framerate since the newest update. (12/30/27) Many people complain about hackers being a big issue where i have only experience 3 with my 432 hours played on NA and AS. The wrost i have experince is guys using wall hacks and aimbot which is not that hard to counter if you are playing squad. Overall i do love this game and will still play with my friends but i do not think it is worth 30$ or worth getting if you have a crappy computer or no one to play with. Edit on (2/3/18) Game is still ing and will not load me fast into matches i am often loading in already in the plane or when the plane is halfway over the map already. Some times when i load in fast i have a glitch where i can only move faceing one direction and the only way to fix that is to restart the game. (3/23/18) game is filled with a lot of hackers and i dont see this game going any where. it was fun when i played and i had a lot of good moments. was worth 30$ but now i wouldnt pay anything more than 10 (7/4/18) I decided to play this game again and it still is but now i would say even worse the menue is sarting to look like a shity mobile game surrounding your menue new skin releases and a new ""battle pass"". i have a gtx 1060 3gb and i7 7700k and this game still doesn not want to run smoothly on my pc recently i have reset my computer because it was clutered and that didnt even help. Still no map selection and the guns they are adding are just reskins of the other guns and so far i have not found any map weapon exclusive guns even tho i havent played much so correct me if im wrong.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS,1,

3978,"2017-12-01",0,0,23,1,0,"I would recommend this game but I won't due to following reasons.1.) Horrible terrible optimization. Sometimes when landing on ground buildings aren't even fully rendered and I can just walk through walls and then it lags out or I get stuck. Overall optimization of the game is just awful. No excuse. I have a mid tier PC and I'm having huge issues playing this game sometimes. And I've heard people with beastly PCs sometimes can't run it smoothly on higher graphics.2.) Clunky. Game just feels clunky all the time. Sometimes you have to press mulitple times (interact) with a door for it to respond so it opens or closes. Picking up loot from the ground sometimes is harder than it looks. Gotta press ""F"" multiple times for my character to react and take the damn loot. Shooting sometimes feels clunky and movement of the game overall. Nothing feels nice and smooth.3.) Lootcrates in early access. I hate being that guy but I mean it's still early access. Focus on your freaking optimization instead of how to milk more money.I would keep on going but I prefer to stick with these 2 major issues above. Game has more issues from what I heard from veterans so read more reviews if you want info on those.Honestly this game has lots of potential.

If you answered yes to any of the above then this game is for you. It's all the heart stopping moments of DayZ and engaging fire fights of Arma all without the walking simulator feel. Not only are you fighting for survival but fighting for prime positioning. You're constantly faced by the threat of enemy players as well as the ever shrinking safe zone. You find yourself pinned down in a building. The circle is moving in and you know both you and the enemy player have to make a move for both of you to survive. What do you do? You'll constantly find yourself in a situation of ""what do I do?"" Sometimes your quick thinking will pay off sometimes it won't. Learn from your mistakes and what else you could have tactically done to make it out alive and push on to the next game. My mindset going into an early access game is to not expect 100% polished game play. I bought the game a few days after it's release expecting it's downsides but I have only witnessed frame rate drops and lag 2 3 times lasting no more than a couple of seconds. I have foliage and effects turned to medium and the game runs awesome for me and by no means do I have a top tier PC. The game does have it's small bugs. Jumping can be a little awkward sometimes you'll hit a bump while driving and next you're flying through the air and if you're spectating a teammate sometimes their movements and shots don't render well. MOST IMPORTANTLY The developers seem to respond to the feedback of players quickly and updates take place regularly. Hopefully they keep up with it. How many times have we given up on early access games because a patch or update ended up leaving the game unplayable? *cough DayZ* Seriously I could go on and on about what I love about the game but I'll stop here and allow for you to get the game and experience it all for yourselves.

Game updates very slowly since launch Game launched in a poor state They refuse to region lock the game which causes so many issues The game has more hackers than any game I have ever played The new map is very flawed in so many ways Some guns have visual feedback while others don't There is little point to using any other gun besides a rifle or sniper rifle and MAYBE the lmg the zone rarely closes in on areas that would give SMG and shot guns a chance. The game is poorly optimized Because the game has lootboxes it will always motivate people to cheatI deicded to uninstall the game and I refuse to play it until the devs region lock china or if their low priority queue actually helps (which I doubt honestly it doesn't help that much with dota 2)Don't buy the game if you don't want to deal with hackers and people with 400 ping it's just not a good experience play fortnite battle royal it's a far superior experience.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS,1,

The console port was a joke it barely worked.It's clear that the devs have given up and are trying to extract as much money as they can before the game dies.

And gun battles is giving my cancer. this game don't buy or play this until they actually put some effort into fixing it instead of adding stupid emotes.I am so sick of seeing these types of games being released half finished games were the rest of the game will either be added over time or sold to us as DLC (Star wars Battlefront) Sea Of Thieves is a perfect example. It's like they came to the board with the idea of an open world pirate game a few ideas for what to do and were then told to make the game and just add their other ideas later. I'm so sick of landing on two maps that i feel like i've played to death same guns and the few new ones that are added will most likely end up in an air drop so unless you want to risk losing all that nice loot you fought hard to get you're not going to touch that fanzy new gun that was added. And of course the cheaters...I don't feel like they have done ANYTHING to fix this MAJOR cheating problem i've gotten so fed up with it that it's tempting to start cheating myself cause it doesn't seem like anything is happening to those people cheating. Instead we get gun skins emotes air drop guns. Not a anti cheat system that works new maps a finished game. NO. All of that will come later after most of the player base are ing done with being killed by cheaters and hackers. I tell you do not waste your money on this game there are so many other great games to spend your money on. Instead of a half piece of battle royale game that feels the need to sue other develepors for making battle royale games even though they are all copying the same genre that has been out far longer then this piece of garbage.

4040,"2017-08-12",2,11,26,1,1,Product received for free. Pretty much everything I wanted out of the individual titles Rust Arma 3 and DayZ combined into one package. A survival battle royale whose goal is to simply be the last one standing on an 8x8 km island super simple premise but the execution is oh so good. .. The pacing is good enough if you end up surviving till the end of a round it's at most 30 minutes.Recent negative reviews have almost ALL been the fact the developer is monetizing crates.... so what? it's cosmetics... anyone complaining about that has no idea how much game development cost I'm sure the developer is expanding their team and using this system to push more quality updates in the future... furthermore you can literally just buy a crate with the points you earn after game sell it and have enough for the key to that crate (considering this game is the most expensive game with the crate system and getting the crates is based on a reward point system based on getting more points if you survive to the end/kill/hit more/etc the crates stay valuable and there's still keyless crates too.)that said there is one downside to this game I've found and it's a texture loading bug where if you parachute in for the first 30 secs give or take textures and buildings entirely don't load (can literally shoot/walk through them/etc...) super serious bug that can be outright game breaking if you don't open inventory and force load (which will freeze you for 15 40 seconds) do it a moment too soon and someone's already killed you when you landed... It's something that desperately needs fixing.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS,1,

I have made support tickets on both their forum and their official helpdesk and in both cases my response was simply ""our evidence supports the initial ban claim it has been reviewed and the ban will stay"". What evidence? Supposedly they can't provide evidence as ""hackers can use it to their advantage"" I think the reality in my case is that there is no evidence.I have clearly been banned by some kind of 0 flag in their anticheat BattlEye as one look at my statistics or a typical game would show you that I'm not even that great at the game I highly doubt someone saw my behaviour and reported me. So this automated system assumedly has me banned and the support staff thoroughly believes that it can do no wrong. Great...There are tons of 0 ban reports out there on the Steam forums for this game on their official forums and in just about every reply to BattlEye on Twitter. I'm sure that while many of these are people who were in fact cheating the sheer numbers say to me that SOME of these people like me must surely have been innocent.Still the developers refuse to believe their bans can be mistaken so I'm missing the money I paid for this game and I have a nasty ""1 ban on record"" blemish on my account. It's probably there forever and the only people who can do anything about it vehemently refuse to do anything about it.So yeah I'm assuming that you don't want to be locked out of a game you paid for with no evidence or support so for that reason I can't recommend this game.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS,1,

Like I said I've been almost 2 months without any Pubg and this week I gave some of my time to this and ... AMAZING how human beings can be manipulated just because it's the game with the most players daily nowadays (cof cof Fortnite) it does not mean it's good.Game pains Going with friends in the finals and our vehicle explodes without even getting damaged or die for vehicle explosion without any vehicles around giving multiple shots in the head with Kar 98 into people with lvl 1 or 2 helmet and getting killed in the next second while using a lvl 3 helmet with one shot of mini 14 landing on the floor with the parachute and after 1 second lose almost half of the health or even more (die) try to play in a random squad and in every server there's full asian team (nothing against asian people but it's really anoying when you try to communicate with people and the only thing they do is screaming in some random asian language. Can you guys start using your asian servers) grenades take different times to explode character / parachute stuck in props lack of updates hte most ridicullous number of hackers at least in every game you find one optimization is the only thing wich is better but still bad killcam bugged sometimes worst hitbox...

4090,"2017-12-17",0,0,33,1,0,I love the games concept 100 man battle royal this game would have me playing hours and hours if it wasn't for the awful optimization of this game.I have literally seen things in toilets prettier than this games optimization. I love the fact that I have to play this game at low settings to be able to experience little to no lag. Whenever I get into a gun fight it always helps that my frame rate plumits to a single digit number. How's my PC you may ask? I can run triple A titles (Battlefield 1 COD WW2 or any highly graphical game) at ultra settings 1080p and keep about 70 80 FPS without dropping below 60. The textures loading in are probably the worst experience ever. Having textures loaded in is like gambling about half the games I play the textures aren't loaded in when I drop onto the map. The textures look worse than Playstation 1 graphics that were half and if they don't load in you have to sit outside and wait for the textures to load in and sometimes you really have to wait. Earlier when I was waiting for the textures to load in I was moving around hoping they'd load and I was experiencing FPS less than 5 and a bunch of freezing. Once the textures did decide to load in about 40 players were dead so in the time that I was waiting for my textures to load half the server got wiped.The game developers know how popular their game is and they probably know very well that this game has had optimization problems so instead of fixing it they make a deal with Microsoft to have it ported to Xbox One where the optimization is god awful. Playing on a normal Xbox One you're looking at a solid 30 fps or below guaranteed.Fix. Your. Game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS,1,

4123,"2018-01-11",0,0,237,0,0,"Overall the game is incredibly fun to play. The mechanics are quite simple that anyone can pick it up. Whether it's Solo's Duo's or Squad's the game still somehow keeps you ""hooked."" That's about all the good things I can say about the game. Now my problem with the game comes in a couple of ways one of them being CHEATERS. I've come across several instances where I get randomly killed from a player who is not even near me. For example one such experience occurred while playing Squad's with randoms. My whole team was in a building taking cover yet somehow everyone got killed through the walls from headshots. Since I was confused on how exactly I got murdered through the wall I ended up reviewing the replay. Apparently someone from who knows where shot at ""random"" through MOUNTAINS and through walls killing me and my whole squad. This infuriates me to no end. With this in mind one thing crucial to keep in mind is that these types of experiences always happen with people who are CHINESE. I understand the creator of this game has spoken of such issue but I'm sorry the creator isn't doing enough to fix the problem. I see many reviews here demanding a region lock for Chinese players and I'm sorry but I have to agree with them. I know it sounds incredibly harsh but I've had it. Another thing since a massive number of Chinese players are now flooding into the North American server it's almost impossible to find someone who speaks ENGLISH. Whenever I click on the NORTH AMERICAN server I expect players speaking ENGLISH. Seriously the server is named North American but almost no one speaks English. This probably sounds extremely petty but I can't enjoy Duo's or Squad's anymore since I cannot understand a single thing from my teammates. Overall I'm going to be supporting the REGION LOCK demand like many others. I know as I've said before it's harsh but I can't take it anymore.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS,1,

But as someone who can look past these flaws when the game runs well which is most of the time it's a really fun and exciting game. No game in the last year has had me sweat like this... You can play with your friends or by yourself. Both options are enjoyable. This game also has a large amount of guns and attatchments unlike its rivals... So there is plenty of variety. The map is pretty big too and it also has unique features on the map so you know exactly where you are. Honestly the way this game is going now it has a promising future ahead especially with its frequent updates. HOWEVER I do feel the price for this game is slightly too high for what they are bringing to the table for new customers.

This game could definetely use some work *cough* optimization for the love of God please *cough*Pros Lots of different types of guns and weapon attachments aswell as gear The ability to choose where you want to land from a plane Gameplay is fun encountering other players is always excitingCons Game is not very well optimized I have a gtx 1080 and an i7 6850k and most of the time I am only getting about 40fps on ultra. The ""safe zone"" and the ""blue line that limits the playing area"" could be improved. They seem like they were implemented towards the end with not much effort put into it. Landing with a parachute can be kind of buggy aswell as it slows you down to the speed of a sloth when landingThis game is a great game for early access with lots and lots of room to improve. The devolpers of this game are not like those of Daybreak this game will be updated and that is what will make this game popular.

4324,"2018-03-16",0,0,21,0,1,PUBG. This game brought light to a niche genre of battle royales. Pretty fun to play but it does have shortcomings. The community is terrible (even if hilarious to me). if you have bad RNG it is impossible to win. Despite this the game is a must have for any gamer. If you are a fortnite player pick this up. (In my opinion) It is a better game. It is a wonderful action shooter game and every battle can be your last. Many shooters don't have the pecision and skill needed but PUBG delivers. Many shooters have some aim assist that makes me feel like my hand is being held but in PUBG I rely on my skill alone.PROS A great shooting experience A fair challenge Fun to play overall Balanced guns (shotguns are a little sucky though) Good to play with friendsCONS Community is worse than CSGO ( If that is even possible) RNG can be a problem even if rarelySome could argue the RNG makes for a better experience but i personally don't like it.OVERALL SCORE 8/10,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS,1,

4337,"2017-06-27",0,0,481,1,1,After the last monthly patch (August) i have changed my review I changed my review from negative to positive this change is thanks to the Dev's hard work at constantly fixing and optimising the game it may take longer to fix some bugs than others but thats the whole purpose of EA.PUBG is now a fully playable game with minimal game breaking bugs if any at all. There are some bugs but these you won't notice i have to give major props to the Dev team for the good work. The cheating in this game has gone right down but the number of scriptors is rising. Scriptors various in different ways and it's highly unlikely you will come accross many at all. The inclusion of FPP was heavily needed with alot of the people in this game heavily relying on third persons issues there is still some issues with FPP such as no leaderboards (coming soon) and the issue with focus lock (holding right click) but this is a problem in TPP also). The ADS alternative in this game which is some sort of focus lock is extremely broken basically when aiming you get 2 options FPP ADS and the Focus lock i am on about the focus lock is highly innacurate and seems to get blocked by the smallest things (E.g. trying to shoot over a buggy is impossible as there are so many random invisible hitboxes that bullets can't seem to pass through best option is to go FFP but you can still have issues.)No doubt my issues i have had will get sorted soon so buy the game and win yourselves some chicken dinners!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS,1,

In reality they're making millions off Chinanese players. Banned for cheating? Just buy a new game.

4353,"2017-08-15",0,0,86,1,1,I have been a console gamer my entire life. Never really got into PC gaming. PUBG released and after watching countless hours of Twitch Streams I finally caved in and ordered a PC literally so I could finally start playing PUBG! It was well worth the purchase as I have put countless hours into the game in the short two weeks I've owned it. This game is by far one of the most intense games I have ever played. Making it into the top 10 on solo matches always gets the heart pumping. The squad matches are extremely fun when the entire team communicates and works together to progress in the match. I also get a lot of enjoyment out of the first person matches and actually prefer playing the squad first person matches over anything else. No real complaints for this game as it is very well put together and fluid for being offered at the 29.99 price point. The only things I could pick at would be the hit detection at times it seems like my shots are missing a guy literally 20 ft away from me with my reticle deal on with the target and sometimes the jumping can be frustrating getting caught on random objects.

4399,"2017-08-07",0,0,74,1,1,"Game's great microtransactions aren't great but they are completely cosmetic and the economy is broken causing items that would normally be &lt $0.10 to be nearly $30.Also don't let the majority of these people fool you whenever it comes to what these microtransactions actually are. There are 3 different types of crates at this moment 2 of which are free to obtain AND free to open. You earn all 3 of these types of crates by earning in game currency based on how you did in the ""battlegrounds."" Like I said 2 of these are free to open one of them requires a key. The key costs $2.50 and the items included in the crate consist of movie tie in items for Battle Royale. If you ask me the items you can recieve via the regular free crates are 100 times better than anything you could recieve in this paid crate not that my opinion really matters.The gameplay is fantastic and it is everything I could have ever wanted in a survival/arena shooter. If you like H1Z1 King of The Kill or The Culling this game is better than both of those.Technically speaking this game is hit or miss. Some of my friends can play this game perfectly without any stuttering while others with superior rigs can't even hit 15 FPS in some areas. This is expected of an Early Access game the dev team should be focused on adding new features to the game not optimizing it. I'm not saying that the game doesn't NEED to be optimized because if the game was released as is today I would not be recommeding it right now.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS,1,

You can play one of two ways on two maps. 1 Drop where everyone is and the game is five minutes or less long. 2 Drop somewhere no one is get awesome loot then die from a guy sniping in a bush somewhere. Don't get me wrong this game is very fun and addicting. The first few hours of gameplay gives you a rush and a sense of nervousness. After you get used it which doesn't take long it becomes stale. There is only one gamemode with two maps. You can't customize your character outside of a god aweful loot crate scam. As a stand alone fully released game it's not good. Not by a long shot. It feels like I got an add on rather than a full game. Don't get me wrong some people enjoy doing the same thing over and over but to be considered a ""full"" game you need to put work into it.

It took a long time for me to actually try it and yes iam a fan of the battle royale genre and knew all about the game since early access release but ended up on the Fortnite band wagon at the time and got hooked... So as I finally got a little time in game today I was greatly underwhelmed at how clunky and unpolished the game feels ... Videos and streams do not do the game justice for how trash it is .... You have to play it ...... I do not recommend this game whatsoever its way too big along with game mechanics graphics and sub par optomization makes for a unfinished and ugly experience ... honestly H1Z1 just a different name and minor updates to certain things ..... I didnt think i would say this after purchasing this pile but Fortnite is ten times the game as far as gameplay optomization and just overall quality of the product .... and its free .......

4493,"2017-11-25",0,0,27,1,0,ProsIts fun if you have friends who can play itPlaying duo or squad with random people can be funThe graphics are OKTheres plenty of places to go Cons VERY badly optimised engine so basically you need a monster pc to run this properlyIts boring.(In my personal opinion) I have not found any fun in this game except for 1.5Hrs of ing around in duo or squad with random people30$? Come on man i wouldn't even pay 15$ for this. 10$ would be a fair price.Its GLITCHY as hell. Theres tons of glitches and unrealism in terms of the vehicles which are terribleYou get a ing heart attack every match because you get hit from somewhere you dont know and the objective is to survive PBtw the reason why its so ing boring is because its the same over and over againMatch die after 5 min(or even faster) repeat.And if you're lucky you'll be holding shift for 20 minutes just to get killed.I know this review is chaotic but i'm just really upset about this game... I wish i could refund it or get money back in some way...The market? Damn. Bluehole sure is making some cash off that INCLUDING valve. You get a 60 cent worth case that is not worth opening every 10 matches or so? I mean its awesome! BUT. Here's the catch of the 60 cent case you get rewarded You have to play this terrible game to get it for a whileOh and uhh the gameplay is ing horrible. I still don't get why this game isn't obsolete since the free to play announcement of Fortnite (Which is an even prettier more fun and overall better game).I would'nt even play this if it were f2p.CONCLUSION Don't buy it. Even though the misleading videos that make it look fun+streamers influence you on buying it.. You'll regret it after 10 20 hrs of playing like me,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS,1,

The game is LOADED with bugs bad optimization a (sometimes) toxic community and devs and streamers being idiots. Bluehole needs to get their priorites straight. They focus on putting microtransactions in the game (Which Brendan Greene promised it wouldn't have) when they need to hurry up and push out the bug fixes and new maps.

You're sneaky you avoid any contact with any other players unless you're 100000% sure you can kill one guy running through the open field. You get yourself to last 10 your palms are sweaty knees weak arms are heavy vomit on your sweater already mom's lasagna. You let those guys kill themselves because you have no freakin' idea where they are. Then when there's only you and one other guy you get headshoted by some ghillie suit guy with AWM 1000 hours played and/or cheats if he's Chinese.Your 145 bpm heart rate drops to 0 scent of chicken dinner fades away.Then you play again.Because you want to be the last man standing.Because you want that freakin chicken.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS,1,

There are way too many bugs and they release loot crates that you need keys to open that you pay for with real money like CSGO crates before fixes. On the note of loot crates first though ive been playing since Early Access probably bought about 100+ crates by now usually get 1 4 every week depending on how much i play/win. Ive only ever gotten ONE item that wasnt grey rarity and it was an uncommon or the greenish rarity. It's absurd how low the drop chances are for some players and how many other players get much better rewards. Maybe im just the unluckiest man on earth but that doesnt seem right somethings wrong there the chances cant be THAT low. Also with the addition of ""pay to open"" crates whenever i get them they basically sit in my inventory forever or i sell them on the marketplace because i refuse to pay money for them (which i shouldnt have to because i bought the game for $30 already) so thats one less chance at an item every week. Its a small issue but a rather annoying one. Just let us buy a damn crate of our choosing with our BP greedy devs.As for an example of bugs my friends discovered TODAY after a ""patch"" that you can walk backwards through a wall in one of the most popular spots in the game at one of the apartments of El Pozo. Obviously they dont bug test enough because that one should be a no brainer. Not only do bugs make it a bad experience but the plethora of ""cheaters"" is absurd and the fact that the loot seems to be RNG based where you can land somewhere and have amazing amounts of ARs SRs meds armor and ammo for a full squad one game but get absolutely nothing in the same area the next and killed by a team with all that loot JUST because of the place you landed. It's ridiculous. Try using pistols to take down a team with level 3 helms vests and m416s its ""possible"" but not probable. Game has serious performance issues as well but im sure thats one of the most discussed issues with the game. Honestly they could remove probably the entire outer edges of the only two maps they have in the game make them smaller because no one ever goes to those locations anyways. Would probably help a little with performace but im no expert.Overall its a great idea a great design even (in some ways) and its really fun to play especially with friends but these large issues that may seem like small ones at first start to grow and grow on you and eventually it just ruins the fun entirely. I'll still play it because of the time ive invested but currently im not enjoying it as much as i used to so in its current state i cannot recommend the game mostly because i want the devs to wake up and fix these issues that have been discussed since the game launched from ""Early Access"".",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS,1,

4602,"2017-12-26",0,0,69,0,1,All year long I was skeptical about purchasing the early access version of this game so I withheld. All year I would stumble upon Youtube videos about PUBG and once in a while check in on some streams of this game. I also play on Xbox and a good friend of mine told me about Fortnite it was fun ... but I felt it was missing more. You know that feeling of being knee deep in your own blood holding on for dear life when an unsuspected goes straight to the loot box of your first victim a great trap just empty out a clip on them and maybe wait for the next on or move on. It felt glorious and that's the feeling I got from this game. I made the mistake of first purchasing the game preview on the Xbox and although fun it was very obvious so much was needed but I played on. A couple days pass and I read update 1.0 has come up for PC I figured 'it's christmas soooo what the hell why not'. In my 5th game i win my first chicken dinner on PC a victorius moment in which I made sure to eat every damn meat of those bones while stuffing some damn mashed potato and gravy in my mouth while I was chewing that glorious chicken because we all know that's how it's meant to be ate! Only thing that bothered me was in the 6th game when I ran to an apparent hacker I don't remember his full name but I remember the last digits of his username *sigh*666 ... yes the damn devil himself killed me and when I looked at the deathcam all I saw was blasphemy. This demon of jackal's **ssy didn't even spot me all it did was unload a clip on the ground and I was dead my soul wrecked by the way I left not even facing this demon of perplexed idiocracy. Every game after that all I can do is watch the ground to be prepared in my attempt to at least try and dodge those bullets spawned from hell in my sleep I'm only full of nightmares of the way I never saw it's face just a blurry bastard laughing over my dead corpse.Seriously tho loved the game here on PC big improvement from game preview on XBX1(obviously).,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS,1,

4624,"2018-01-07",0,0,1192,0,0,Hey Kids!Are you looking for a great time picking up guns and then using it to shoot the nearest person you see well look no further. Do you want to have a jolly Ol time? Looting for guns Redbull and Oxycodine for 10 to 20 minutes then getting immediatly one shot killed by another rule abiding player that just so happens to use a fair and reasonable wall hack/aimbot. If you like what your hearing so far wait just a cotton picking minute theres more! If you love spending countless hours trying to improve your playing ability to enjoy this game even further then you can go ahead and shove that enthusiasm right into a BlueHole because when you start to enjoy this game even just a bit it will bring you complete frustration and anger beyond your wildest imagination. I will however recommend this game when the developers will realize that revenue isnt important especially when cheaters get banned then rebuy the game over and over but quality in gameplay is what wins over the hearts and minds of loyal PUBG gamers. I would like to suggest if I may that instead of banning cheaters why not put all cheaters on dedicated servers with other cheaters after multiple cheating reports and let them get a taste of their own medicine. That way they quit instead of rebuying the game but that idea seems like a fantasy.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS,1,

4638,"2018-02-12",0,0,482,0,0,After 400+ hours on this game and playing in the beta I can definitely say that this is one of my favorite games. When I first got the game though it most definitely needed optimization and bug fixes and such it was far superior to it's hacker simulator state that it is in right now. Everything is perfect about this game and I hate to point out what erveryone else is complaining about but Asian servers definitely need to be locked and though they did just release an anti cheat update it still needs fixing. Not only is it not very effective on cheats being used ingame but it causes rubber banding and other weird bugs considering movement. For right now I wouldn't recommend this game until they do something about the infestation of Chinese players and hackers in North American servers.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS,1,
4639,"2017-08-02",0,0,503,0,0,Hi! Few things to start off with 1. Yes I added you because you're a female gamer 'tis an awesome thing to see! 2. I'm Brian. 3. Don't be intimidated but I'm not a stereotypical guy. If anything I'll be the one in the kitchen D. In all seriousness this game is not as great as it seems. If you actually happen to read this review this game sucks. Dishonest developers who pretend to listen to community feedback a 1.0 tag to make the game look better yet it feels like it is in early beta changes that are made to the game just to change it not serving a real purpose etc. The gameplay itself would be fine if it weren't plagued with horrible instability and optimization cheaters and hackers and truly awful servers and hit registration. I've quit this game because every time I should be getting a kill the game won't give it to me. You feel like a bag of popcorn when going against any other player they take around twenty shots to kill or at least it feels this way due to ping but you'll take about a hit and be knocked instantly to half of your health when you had better amor and weaponry that your opponent. This game is horribly inconsistent and not fun to play. Please save your thirty dollars so you won't be earraped by chinese players who don't stay in their own server and developers who don't understand that it's ok to region lock a playerbase that has three servers closer to their homeland than the U.S. servers. Can't even play the game I paid for anymore and it has descended through the greed of bluehole as they make more money they decide to not fix the game and simply add the cashgrap lootboxes.

But just in case...It's a battle royale game where you jump out of the plane with 99 other players find loot to kill them and at the same time be in the zone which gets smaller every few minutes.I've seen a lot of people complaining about the hackers but I really dont think it's that big of a problem. With 90+ hours I've never met single one or maybe I didn't noticed him but either way I don't see it as a problem. On the china servers it's definitely worst.Combat in this game is easy to learn hard to master situation. You basically find a gun maybe even a scope and you point on the enemy and try to shoot him nothing hard really except for the hip fire distance to enemy (need to prefire him) and your location on the map. If your enemy is gonna have a better position (better cover high ground etc) you'll need to get a better position too or you'll be dead. But don't forget about the zone oh dear how many time have I died to zone when I was fighting other guy DYou're gear is very important(Make sure to look for helmets and vests) cause headshots are very deadly if you're not careful enough. Try to find long range weapons cuz usually you're gonna use them more than close range (usually you shoot to people pretty fair away from you)You can play solo but i recommend squad cause is soo much more fun to play with friends for me. And fighting another squad is always adrenaline DAnd what I don't like about this game?Well...Let's start with server delay. By that i mean every time I want to pick something from the ground I have to pick it twice or more times. It used to be worse but it's not perfect yet. Also sometimes I have to reload twice cause the servers didn't register it probably.However I am happy to say that this doesn't appear to be a problem when you're shooting st someone the hitboxes seems to be right.Then there is this felling of repetition.Now this is only subjective but after quite a lot hours in the game I am pretty much doing the same over and over again. I jump out of a plane land look for weapons loot and start killing other players and going to the zone. Yes every game is different but you're doing same thing as before. I don't want compare this game with different one but let's just this. In Hunt Showdown you're playing as a hunter and you'll be trying to kill the boss and escape with bounty to one of 3 extraction points. However u can play this game so many ways. Especially in the night missions you can choose to sneak trough the bushes and look for Hunters you can play agresive rush in a try to kill the boss and escape listen for footsteps and other sounds of other hunters and plan your ambush there's just so much you can do.I am not here to on pubg really.It's a great game and I understand why is it so much popular. I still really enjoy playing it just not that much as I used to.So should you buy this game? If u vave a decent PC and you like battle royale games then yeah go for it!But don't play this game only because everyone else is playing it even if you don't really enjoy it cuz why would you be playing a game that you don't enjoy. bugs server delay repetive gameplay almost no stealth and of course toxic community but that's in every popular game sadly (I can't really think about more negatives.After all it's not a bad gameI'll give it 8/10!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS,1,

4783,"2018-01-01",0,0,293,0,1,"For those of you that don't want to read my whole review here is the tl dr. This is one of the best games of 2017 in my opinion. This game is fun and action packed. It's not as glitchy and full of hackers and everyone thinks there are (I've only every encountered 1 or 2) and it's way more enjoyable if you have a few friends to play it with. For those of you who want to here the long version here it is. *Gameplay* The gameplay is really solid. It goes like this Find weapon kill people move into circle kill more people die and get second place rinse and repeat. The movement of the character feels nice and the maps are built around the realistic physics engine which helps make it feel emmersive. All the guns feel powerful to shoot. And there is sorta a learning curve to the weapons but if you have played any other realistic shooter you should feel right at home. *Graphics* By no means is this the best looking game. I think it is good looking but not the best. The view distance for foliage is not very high even when the setting is turned all the way up. I know this is for performance reasons but it is noticable. And that is kinda the theme for this ""graphics"" section of my review. They didn't make it the best looking game because then people couldn't run it. It does look good but not the best. I really don't know how else to put it. *Hackers* Just like I mentioned above I don't think hackers are really a big deal for this game. I've only ran into 1 or 2 hackers in my 90 hours of play time. Just recently the devs banned 1.5 million people for hacking. That goes to show that yes there are hackers in the game but yes the devs are working on getting them out of it. I don't think this is going to be a big deal for a lot of people. And just remember some people are just better than you. I DOESN'T mean they are hacking. *Optomization* It is true that the game is not that optomized. You will have to have a decent computer to run it. But not anything outrageous. I have a GTX 1060 6GB with an I5 6600k (OC to 4.6GHz) and I play at 1440p medium to ultra settings and I get a constant 60 FPS. Yes the optomization could be better but it's good enough to have a fun gaming session. *Competitors* There's no doubt that Fortnite is a huge competitor to PUBG. I think PUBG is more fun but that is just my opinion. I see the appeal in Fortnite. It's way better optomized and it's free... But I promise you PUBG will continue to get support for years to come. I think it has a longer lasting appeal. But again that's just me. Ok I'm done now. If you want a recap go back up and read my tl dr because my fingers are getting tired of typing.

4818,"2018-01-29",0,0,81,0,0,Mediocre is how I would describe this game. It is fun to play with friends at times but recent development choices are ruining the game. Loot crates were recently introduced that you have to pay to open. So you play the game and get points you then use those points to get a crate which holds a vanity item. It used to be you just spent the points and you got the crate and open it but now you spend your points and have to Pay $2.50 to open a crate that is just going to give you a junk vanity item. The whole thing is just sad. This game is really not finished at all it doesn t look or play particularly well and constantly has connection and bug issues. The DEV just took it out of early access so that he could make money and speed along the console release. In my opinion it s not worth your money.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS,1,

Got bored.Bought PUBG.Got in game dropped in at the military base got wrecked in 5 minutes.Second round Won first place with my squad of friends.Third round Won first place with that same squad.Best shooter with squads I've played and the adrenaline rush is SO real.**********EDIT**********Game's good however after 250+ Hours Ingame and by no means am I the worst player in the world. When nobody is hacking 6+ kills a game is rather easy fire fights are extremely intense fair footed shot for shot killing fun and you do NOT DIE INSTANTLY EXCEPT to the obvious ""Oh crap he blew my vest or helmet off then finished me just like that Should've ran"". The hacks come back a couple weeks after every big update and it pretty much goes like this.Jump in land loot get a kill because someone had nothing loot a couple more buildings notice a sickly trend of really good loot getting left behind in crates ammo missing but main guns like M416 SCAR L KAR98's etc all getting left behind (Doesnt happen when people survive more than 2 minutes before getting wrecked) get outside think you're safe leaving a city get killed by an instant headshot or full auto at a distance watch kill cam get extremely frustrated and scream at your friends that you hate this game while they're in complete denial of the entire situation.What to expect from a hackers kill cam EVERY time Erratic snappy movement due to Aim bots cross hairs following you through buildings behind cover because of ESP hacks quick switch between rifles 0.01 second scope times no scope kills at 100+ meter distances using assault rifles on full auto snap to instant headshot with pistols and shotguns at insane distances and even aimbots tracing your head with no scope and no recoil in short range (Pay attention to bullet holes behind you if you're in stairwells).The dead giveaway is always the de sync caused by how insanely fast their cursor is snapping around to your position while you're hiding/running through buildings and cover and then to you when you pop out.Long story short I originally 1 this game however I've changed my mind. It was amazing hopping in and EARNING those first 20 or so chicken dinners within 30 matches in the beginning. The Intensity The Adrenaline rush of winning in a game where the odds are SO low was unrivaled compared to any BR games that existed in the beginning Including H1Z1 but for it to amount to what it's become?

The sooner they address this problem the sooner I'll consider changing my review..If you agree with me do the same. write a similar review about your opinions voice our concerns guys! UPDATE/EDIT does anyone think they'll get their together?it's like they don't give a flying crap wether they fix the game or not never have I ever been so frustrated because of a stupid bug that occurs EVERY GOD DAMN GAME! MY MICROPHONE STOPS WORKING EVERYTIME I LAND ON THE ISLAND! not to mention all the CHEATING ASIANS flooding EVERYONEs servers god forbid any of us actually get to enjoy this game.PUBG CORP ARE RUINING EVERYTHING!

4869,"2018-01-26",0,0,671,0,0,I played PUBG for 671 hours before uninstalling today and writing this review. I have won solo duo and squad games inclluding winning 1 v squad. I am by no means the best player on Earth but believe I can make a fair assesment.Pros The game does a good job with the gun mechanics things like bullet drop and recoil are nicely done. There is a good veriety of weapons and I woudn't call any weapon garbage. The game does have pixel level accuracy. If someone is holding up a weapon and you shoot them in the chest it may hit their arm instead and do different amounts of damage. If you see someone's nose stick out the corner of a window you can head shot them. The design of the maps is well done in that there is a good amount of verity multiple entry/exit points and vaulting added a much needed way of entering/exiting buildings/walls easily.Cons The game is very heavily luck based in that you never know what items you will find and were you will find them. Yes there are areas in which higher quality loot spawns but they are very crowded and then again becomes luck. Are you going to be the one to drop in front of a smoke grenade or a full automatic weapon. The majority of the game will be spent looting and walking for 20 or so minutes and then being killed by someone you never see. Hacking happens far more often than any game i've seen in a long time. I have had arrows sticking out of my neck moments after dropping out of the plane to enter the map. I have been headshot in a closed room by a guy aming at a mountain. It is very difficult to practice the aiming/shooting mechanics other than to drop into a major city and hope you get lucky since player interaction happens so infrequently. I have had many games where I never saw another living person until I was killed by one. Sever lag while not game breaking IMO does happen every so many games. I've been on a motocycle and had lag toss me upside down while driving on a road and I've had instances where I get my car stuck inside a solid object which makes my car explode. This does not happen very often but it can. I believe all of the maps are too big. There is a truth in the fact that one of the tags for PUBG is 'Walking SImulator'. They really need a smaller map.Unfortunately there is only a like or dislike button otherwise I would pick 'its ok'. If you like a more realistic battle royal game that is skill/strategy based you'll like this game a good amount of the time. If you've played games heavily based in aiming like Counter Stike you'll pick it up easy. if you've played FortNite and think you'll jump into this no problem you may be in for a suprise. For me personally I have gotten to the point I am frustrated more often than I am happy. I log off angry more often than I log off satisified that I spent my time on PUBG. If you like battle royal games its worth a try if you just want to try it because its popular I think you'll be dissapointed.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS,1,

You'll often times shoot someone in the face with a shotgun only to find out that it didn't hit in time. A lot of players on North American servers are from other parts of the world lagging up the servers.Some of the animations/models are a bit chinsey.Can be frustrating spending 10 minutes gathering good gear only to get wiped out in a 2 second firefight.Needs shot directional meter showing you what direction you got hit from.

4894,"2017-05-03",0,0,411,0,0,Don't buy this game the dev's do not care about the community. Cheaters in every other game and the solution isnt stopping cheating its banning them. Obviously if that worked the problem wouldnt persist. In addition the game was 'released' prematurely with dozens of bugs that have existed for over a year now and the lack of a map selection a looting system that rewards luck rather than skill and more RNG than simulated dice.Original review I am in the pre load area and decide to take my clothes off and run around naked. Land on the ground... still naked. First thing i can put on is a ballistics mask so I look super BDSM. After that I aquire shirt vest trench coat trousers helmet but no shoes. Also plenty of guns and ammo D. 30 minutes later me and my friend are camping a house and a prick walks in and shoots my buddy. I kill his attacker with a shotgun and steal my buddy's shoes that I have coveted the whole game. Next I kill the attacker's buddy and head for the center with a motorcycle running over one dude and blasting the other with my shotgun before being killed by the electric barrier traveling at lightspeed with me only a foot outside where it stops. End the game at team #4 with 4 kills for me 2 for my (deceased) partner. 10/10 would steal my best friend's shoes off his dead body again.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS,1,

4909,"2017-06-12",0,0,282,0,0,"I WANT to enjoy this game... but it seems that I CAN'T enjoy this game.First off if you are not a fan games where you must die repeatedly in order to achieve success (like Dark Souls for example) then you will likely not enjoy this game. *Puts on tin foil hat* Also every time I have something negative to add to this review Steam suddenly has a ""problem communicating with the servers."" *Take off tin foil hat* Play Area Restrictions As each match progresses the play area is reduced in intervals and anyone caught outside slowly starts losing health (which by the way gets worse as the match goes on). While the idea looks good on paper its execution (pun intended) is extremely harsh. Once the play area begins to constrict around its new projected field it contracts so rapidly that you are completely unable to keep up with it on foot. Basically you have two options Find a vehicle or stay ahead of the constriction. Sounds easy enough until the Random Number Generator decided that you have to run 2 kilometers in under 3 minutes. Good luck... oh wait you died. Nevermind.*UPDATE* 3 Jan 18 Nothing's changed here the circle is still brutal and unforgiving. Simply put it is a means to limit the playtime of each match. Personally this seems to me like the vast majority of the player base just doesn't have any patience to play the long game. I'd still rather die in a gunfight than to nothing or no one. Vehicles The transportation in the game is decent up until you start driving on hills. This is where either you luck with the RNG runs out again or the physics engine needs some work. Haven't quite figured out which it is yet but anyways... if you try to jump a vehicle off a hill or a ledge it will start rotating in a random direction that doesn't even make sense for the angle it left the ground. This happens less often with the heavier vehicles though so at least they go that part right. But to make things worse the controls provided in game to adjust the vehicle in flight do not respond fast enough to correct this error. This is counter intuitive with my previous point that the play area restrictions are too fast. You have to go full speed to keep up and if you're stuck in a hilly area you might as well just kill yourself. Or quit. Yeah quitting is faster.*UPDATE* 3 Jan 18 Nothing new here either. Several instances of flipping vehicles over the smallest of bumps. Advice for new players Slow down speed bumps ahead. Game Crashes/Not Responding *UPDATE* 3 Jan 18 Had one crash since the game went Full Release out of about 40 games or so. Hacker Handling It happens in just about every game to some extent someone hates losing so much that they have to cheat or they do it just ""because they can."" Well I've had 5 questionable deaths now (compared to the other 90 something where I know I got outplayed) that made me wonder how the hell the other player managed the feat. While I wansn't able to prove anything I was still curious if I even COULD report a hacker. Well it turns out you have to go register to a third party web site which just so happened to crash every time I tried to register an account. Wonderful.Also the rate in which I seem to get loot f*cked makes me wonder how some of these players are doing so much better than I am when it comes to finding good gear. Either they are the Developers and they're on a power trip or the top ranked players know the developers and are really good at brown nosing. Now 150 matches in and this theory hasn't been proven wrong yet.*UPDATE* 3 Jan 18 After having learned that there were over 1.5 million players banned for hacking/cheating AND the implementation of a death camera (THANK YOU) I have been religiously watching everytime someone eliminates me. The half second delay between what you see and what actually happens is a bit of a throw off but I have witnessed a few players using some kind of auto aim hack. Roughly 1 in 10 deaths look like the reticle is locked onto my avatar. The fact that so many people feel the need to ""mod"" the game is pathetic and creates a poor play experience. If I could I would summon the Terrible Terry Tate Office Linebacker to take care of each and every one of you. Glitches HIT DETECTION If i am aiming down my sight why the hell is my bullet making contact with a vehicle I am standing next to? So I'm trying to shoot someone with my muzzle shoved up my car's a$$? Come on. *UPDATE* 3 Jan 18 No new instances but (See Next) Bullet Penetration There is none. There are planks of wood that will block your 7.62 rounds. Seems like an oversight to me. *UPDATE* 3 Jan 18 Got worse. Now you can't shoot through fences or metal railings with 6 inches of clearance between the bars. Had a guy dead to rights with an SKS and 4x scope looking through a metal railing. *TING!* No damage. Had to get all the way around the railing. ***NEW*** Weapon Switching There have been a couple games now since the Official Release where I am prevented from switching weapons especially in critical situations. If I run out of ammo in my primary weapon and try to switch to my secondary instead of reloading SOMETIMES it will let me. At first it was because I had Aim Down Sight set to toggle and while I was aiming down the sight I couldn't switch. Okay fine. They now have separate key binds for ADS and just Aiming so I did that AND set ADS to Hold. Problem solved? Nope. Other Concerns Aiming through Windows and other Openings So when you're trying to aim down sight though a window from a crouched position while adjacent to said window you don't always have enough height to see over the bottom of the window sill to actually see through. So you have to stand. I can't say if the developers designed the windows like this on purpose to force players to stand while aiming out of windows but why would anyone want to do that? I disagree with this and would consider it a design flaw because based on the height of the character models compared to most windows I should be able to stand on my knees and aim through a window without exposing too much of myself. As many times as I've been shot and killed from concealed positions I don't see this making a huge difference. I still won't know where the shot came from.*UPDATE* 3 Jan 18 Still not fixed. Also seems like other players CAN shoot through windows while crouched but I (or my teammates in squads) can not. Is there a secret pay wall for this ability that I don't know about? Doors Can we PLEASE see an option to SLOWLY AND QUIETLY open a friggin door? I don't care if it take three full seconds but having that option would be an improvement.*UPDATE* 28 Nov 17 No change though this one is a request and not a bug.**NEW** 16 Jan 18 WEAPON JAMMING/NOT FIRINGAfter the last update I am experiencing increased instances of my weapons NOT firing when I pull the trigger (click mouse button). This has led to several deaths that could have been kills and I don't know if it's actually a glitch or if it's the server lagging at just the wrong moment or if there's a new hack on the market. PROS First Person View Mode Free updates no paid DLC Vaulting and Mantling is in and it works great so far. *UPDATE SUMMARY* 3 Jan 18 Some things fixed others stay the same. The game itself ins't bad. I still play it because I want to make it better... but the HACKERS just ruin what could be an otherwise great game. With about 3 million concurrent players and almost HALF that number of banned players cheating is a MAJOR problem these guys are forced to deal with rather than focus on making the game better. So for all you pieces of dog that can't play the game without a hack running... congratulations! You still suck.

4926,"2018-01-16",0,0,1122,0,0,"Welcome to Playerunknown's Battlesgrounds. These used to be playerdriven without any kind of hacker community apparent. Within a few patches however it became a digital wasteland filled with hackers and bugs abound. Cars spontaneously doing backflips from resting state sending you thousands of miles into the air Guns having an indefinite accuracy making the closest engagements acts of wonder. Hit boxes are amiss loot askew Recoil scripts/hacks are abound and my most favorite inaccurate representations of grenades/utility grenades' arc. I've missed several grenades because of the inaccuracy of the arc. Its more just a guessing game instead of giving you an actual chance at throwing them. I was one of the first to brave the storm with this game and now it has become something unenjoyable. Still playable but extremely lopsided due to hackers and bugs. If the game fixes its issues with hackers fix the weapon bugs true recoil and realistic damage of weapons it will be a solid 8/10. But as of this moment I'd rather recommend players to Last Man Standing. Which is just as equally plagued but doesn't cause the disappointment of spending 30 dollars on instability and inconsistency. Let's also not forget the millions of dollars this company has acquired yet cannot fix any of the true issues at hand. I have achieved over 30+ chicken dinners all with photographic proof over 600+ hours of gameplay. Pros Great team game extremely engaging.Immersion of both environment and situation.Cons HackersGun DamageGun AccuracyVehicle Bugs which send you off in random directions or spontaneously kill youEnvironmental catastrophies in which traffic cones stop vehicular movement from any speed including Tin fences singular barrels caution barriers etc.While skydiving into your area your parachute has a chance to stop working completely or completely launch your character in a direction killing him/her instantly. I'd love to recommend this to the next person but understand this game you may purchase was titled ""E sports ready"". It comes with an unprecedented wave of disappointment until the multi million dollar corporation that owns this title steps forward and actually engages these issues.

4988,"2014-03-19",0,0,28,1,0,A unique game and a very fun one at that. A fun one for about a day. The gameplay is pretty unique and extremely entertaining and most of all time consuming. You gotta survive you have to acquire weapons friends resources build a house and basically sustain yourself while other players try to raid your house or simply assassinate you while you're out in the open only to grab your goods and use it for themselves. All this only to be killed by a hacker from across the map then spawn in your house then be killed in a fraction of a second again through a wall and you lose all you've done. Its a great game but the number of hackers is insane. IN. SANE. Every game has hackers but not likt this this is just beyond words. A minimum of 4 hackers on every server. No exaggeration.Verdict Don't waste your time and money on this joke until something is actually done to ban hackers.,Rust,1,

I enjoy the risks of searching Rad towns and villages exploring the powerplants hunting in the vallys and calling airdrops. Overall Rust lacks a few things protection from hackers and modders are not up to standered. I couldn't count the amount of times I have been found specificly on a map in an impossable to climb hill unless you take a certain path I found about 30 minutes into trying to find. Another downside is that once someone is OP they are next to impossable to kill. That may sound great if you yourself were OP but if the glove was on the other hand you would understand.I would recommend Rust if you are up for challenges and adventure.

5007,"2015-06-07",0,0,24,1,0,I only have bad thing to say about this game. First of. When you join a server you will soon realise that you are on the bottom of the food chain and the only way to get higher up is to raid and hit barrels. After like 10 hours or maybe 2 5 if you have a bit of luck then you MIGHT be able to have a blueprint for a real gun... But that is kind of your only goal when you have gotten yourself a gun then the game is kind of over. 1/10 for the love of god don't buy this game.,Rust,1,

5011,"2015-03-01",0,0,386,1,0,Rust has had it ups and downs. Currently it. is. bad. They've made everything much harder and time craving with the new updates. You cant demolish buildings stones are almost impossible to find and wolves are still OP as f**k. Speaking of animals before you could run and hit animals with the same speed now you get slowed down slightly when you press the hit button. When the animals travels faster than a speeding bullet getting resorces is impossible. Now we also have to repair the tools you have. REALLY?! It makes the game even more frikkishly annoying and unberable. We also have to find blue prints everywhere in barrels airdrops and whatnot. DOES THE DEVELOPERS JUST LOVE F*CKING UP THEIR GAME? It seems like it. Unless they can find a way to fix these bugs fast as humanly possible I won't recomend this game to anyone who want to have a good time. Side not to the dev team CHANGE IT BACK TO THE PREVIOUS VERSION aka how it was 2 months ago.,Rust,1,

5013,"2017-04-10",1,1,7,1,0,Wasn't a fan I tried this game out for about 4 days played about 7 hours tried about 12 different servers and it always ended the same. You spawn (and if you don't get murdered right away by a spawn camping troll) you go and collect materials to survive and make tools so you can build a shelter. So you run along getting things you need (if you dont get kiled by a troll) and make a house. Then you have to eat so you go hunt (if you dont get killed by a troll) then you build a fire to cook the meat (if you dont get killed by a troll) from there I cant tell you what you do becuase I kept getting KILLED BY ING TROLLS. Everyone talks no one will help you players attack you on sight for sport you spawn again with nothing and if players dont get you animals will. The game is truely the most frusterating thing I've ever encountered. I usually enjoy games like this and thought this one would be a hit but it comes down to the amount of jackasses playing it that ruins the game.,Rust,1,

5033,"2014-01-15",0,0,48,1,1,Great survival game that mixes elements from DayZ and Minecraft. About a 1 hour learning curve playing solo but the game is intuitive and fairly simple once you get the hang of it.The PVP is a strong selling point for the game. Once you have gathered and crafted resources built up a base you and some friends can start raiding other groups' villages and loot all their belongings or of course you can just be friendly and build up an empire and recruit. Your choice! Which is another pretty cool feature of the game.,Rust,1,

The game is a time to win game where the longer you play on the game the stronger you become and also skills will also come into play.Rust Experimental (new verison) The new version really puts the Sandbox world into Rust unlike Rust Legacy you dont need the time and effort to dominate the server all you need is some players a good spawn (Forest Grasslands) and you will have everything you need. Because there is no C4 Gernades Mods or Defences. you can break into a house with a rock (Given you have enough time) As the game progreses I am sure the dificulty of defeneding and attacking houses will be changed.,Rust,1,

My friend owns a server and we host a very popular Arena PvP event that satisfies the psychos need to kill poor people pretty well. That being said never trust anyone who you don't know and never leave your house with anything you don't want to lose. You can find servers with a lot of friendly people but even still the jerks like ruining anything that can in any way possible.

Ark is way better but this is pretty good. Well for almost 4 days now game will not start. Did a ticket and uploaded to facepunch and they responded within hours. That was 4 days ago. Tried to refund and steam says no so I pay 35 bucks to play a game for 2 weeks. Console coming soon as I wont tolerate this type of treatment to a Long term customer. Be careful and if you buy you have 2 hours of gametime before you cant return for refund. BS you ask me.Peace,Rust,1,

For those who complain about Lag/Crashes either upgrade your pc or your internet. I have 700 hours on record and not once have i had issues apart from minor frame drops during early access. The best part is the fact that they are always updating the game. Since early access they have been non stop releasing updates.

Ive never enjoyed being hunted for sport so much. unfortunately players like Nebsss that door camp players with 25 hours time played without any provocation (id cop it if i was being an hat like him) are the reason i wont dedicate anymore real time to this game.Might look for that aforementioned group though hell of alot more fun when you dont spend all your time maintaining your base.,Rust,1,

5204,"2019-01-13",0,0,5,0,0,On my main account i have over 600 hours on this game.. At the start it was really fun to play with my friend and when there was a server contest for 20 50 eur we would always win.. Those times were really fun for me and i was addicted to the game. When our favourite server got shut down i took a 3 month break and came back to the game being full of useless updates that don't make the game fun for me at all.. All you do in this game is start with a rock get some wood make a base and then just quit because the game has all these updates that make you grind and be good at the game..Never liked the grinding part of games because i always thought games were meant to be fun. To be honest early access felt like a completed game and in a lot of parts wasn't even broken. All i have to say those 600 hours were the best and the most fun in rust i have had and now that i know i wont ever get 1k hours on this game makes me sad and it's all because of the updates with scientists boats tree minigames that don't work most of the time puzzles. I hope i would be able to go back to 2017 when i started to play the game and had some good fun. Go watch facless's most recent videos on how rust really is meant to be played and you will understand why the community and everything else has ruined the game and how new people usually just refund the game after 30 minutes just because they get killed by an who runs around with a semi rifle near where the nakeds spawn and just kills them over and over just because someone did it to them.. I have only had 1 time i've saw a cheater so i think it's not really infested with them... (subscribe to facless if you already haven't) bye. never playing this game again until they remove the show of updates or make it easier to play.,Rust,1,

5224,"2019-01-30",0,0,6,0,1,Rust is a very time consuming game to finally get started in. If you want (in my opinion) go into crowded servers when you learn the basics of this game. The game is a overall good and fun game. BUT has a serious problem with little kids running servers and helping there friends and also a moder problem. But if you can get away from that then you can have a fun time. Just remember going solo in the game is very difficult. There are alot of teams in this game that can ruin your day. Even though I have 2.9 hours on record This is a solid game. I would reccommend this to a person who love a challenge and survival games.,Rust,1,
5225,"2017-09-15",0,0,1416,0,1,This game can be a lot of fun if you can find a server that fits your playstyle and the amount of time you can commit. There are plenty of modded servers that offer a completely different feel compared to vanilla. I play solo a few hours a week and still enjoy the game on a monthly non bp wipe solo server.Fixes Any BP (blueprint) you can find inside a barrel/crate they need to make default. Why do I have to find a BP for a bear rug or guitar? A solo player has to learn a BP for each item he wants to craft but a group of 5+ players only needs one player to learn it to be able to craft them so groups have a huge advantage over solos. Groups should be forced to research an item or be penalized by the item breaking faster during use. Since they added BP's to the game there is basically NEVER BP wipes on official servers which seems to defeat the purpose of adding them.,Rust,1,

Although it s also one of those games where you almost need to commit to at least a couple days of your life. That is if you want to have a chance of survival. When you start you will be a nice normal human being. Just after a couple hours you will become a toxic person. As you will be building your base and be so proud. Then inevitably will be blown shy high once you decide that you committed enough time for the day. You will go to sleep and once you wake up you will be upset. You will wake up to your body on the starting shore. You will run back to your base to find they destroyed your sleeping bag and cabinet. And it happened like the middle of the night so everything you put time into is gone. You will sit there and back out of the game for a day. You will restart and this process will continue over and over until you are the top of the food chain causing trauma to other players. But yeah It s a good game.,Rust,1,

Doesnt run so well on my pc. I honnestly reccommend this game to all those out there. So many different ways to play this game it suits just about everyone. Dont like grinding? you can play modded. like fighting? play battlefield servers. dont like fighting? weirdo. So many options to choose from.I remember when i first bought this game i was still in high school and it was just before the summer holiday i spent everyday playing Rust through the summer ( it was legacy back then) and it quickly rose to my most played game and has held the position since. Many childhood memories have been replaced by memories from rust. Its amazing how i can remember so many different wipes from over the years. Ive run shops traps zergs roleplaying bases and i even was an admin and a chat moderator. I have met so many people and made friends from all countries this game has given me so much and unlike other games this game has been so cheap. ( Rainbow Six and Overwatch in particular) I probably have spent under 35 on this game over all the years and hours ive spent. Whereas ive likely spent around 100 on each overwatch and rainbow six.Anyway try this game. Its provided me with something to do for 6(ish) years.Thankyou Facepunch for unlimited hours of fun for me and my friends. You have put so much effort into this game and we all appreciate it.,Rust,1,

I know I'm not a ""Veteran"" of Rust like a lot of other people with thousands of hours but I don't need that much time to be able to tell how good this game is. I know I don't have much playtime yet but I have played 14.5 hrs in 3 days. I know what you're thinking I don't have a life. That is only PARTLY true I still have school and homework and friends and family and I am going into high school so that just goes to show that I took time out of my busy day to play this. It can be a little toxic sometimes but there are still lots of nice people if you just look. Overall this game is worth it. To be honest it is worth sixty dollars or more and I wish there was a deluxe edition or something because I would have bought it. Also if you want good Rust gameplay because you're still unsure about whether to buy it or not check out the youtuber Welyn founder of the Pumpkin Gang! Also check out Enardo he's great too!

5283,"2017-11-05",0,0,889,0,1,I have played Rust for 6 months total now and have about 900 hours and this is my review based on my experience.WARNING This game is HARD! Note before buying you will die lots. The graphics at maximum are stunning though the game is poorly optimised despite what the developers say as of now. To run it this way at a solid framerate you will need a top end PC. Otherwise you will most likely have to turn down the settings.The audio quality is pristine and the stereo and surround sound is accurate and has a wide variety of settings for different audio configurations. Footsteps are easy to hear which improves gameplay also.The game mechanics are some of the grindiest I've seen although if you have 10 hours a day spare for the game it is worth it. The building is easy to pick up on the gunplay is skill based with recoil patterns and no RNG and the crafting system is simple however the blueprints and workbenches can be a pain to farm for especially for solo players.The community is full of extremely toxic teenagers although there are a few good apples out there. If you can get past that then it is an enjoyable experience.,Rust,1,

No idea...........maybe I will get to play it eventually but it seems like waiting time 30min 1h to play................................Not much to recommend so far.Connected to community servers hit trees with rock(??) and got one hit from something. AGAIN.Why do people like this.... knows )))**UPDATE**I will leave my old review so it would be visible what was the thoughts from the beginning.So managed to get into game seems more servers are reachable and wait time doesn't exist anymore (no idea why it was previously so...).Game idea is interesting and fun but the mechanics are a bit broken.Basically if you're starting now from fresh (servers get wiped after a while and everyone starts anew) you are running butt naked and trying to survive against people who already progressed and with guns but have no fear you have a rock )) You WILL die multiple times to god knows who or what until you will start to get some grasp of game and if by then you are not frustrated then just wait.... )) Because when you realize that you need some sort of base to continue learning the game and building be prepared to be raided every day even multiple times. Videos online will guide you to how build those bases both small and large but reality is that it won't matter. You will wake up and the place will be raided or someone from a clan sees you and they will raid you within seconds (presumably you can fix walls but you won't make it in 2s to do anything wood or stone doesn't matter). On videos it says it takes more time to go through rock or steel but in reality groups of people can blow whatever you have there within seconds it isn't expensive for them at all even if raiding is not worth they will do it just for the gig. So it definetely caters to grouped players and it will be hard to learn anything as a solo. Disregard those solo videos on youtube to get to that level you will grow gray hair and will have to play like the game is your y spouse not a game to have fun in ) There's more to add but basically....I can't recommend it just because the idea is nice graphics are good and feel of the game itself is attractive the gameplay is pure cancer for a player that plays solo and even if it is more than 5h a day not to mention some casual person....just don't waste time and money.If you would want to start fresh well all of what I said plus other irritations and the fact that you will be up against groups of people and solo people who are much more experienced and will just die endlessly and spawn all over the place for other player amusement. To get to those levels of experience or finding someone you can trust to play with headache that will drain you until you won't even want to play the game itself.If I would need to give marks to the game Graphics 8/10Music 9/10Environment 8/10 (although small maps even those that say are big).Price 3/10 (should be someting like 9.99GBP not much content (comparing to A titles) and it is still ongoing project (as i understand...).Fun 4/10 (it is fun for 2 3 days have 15h of play time since I bought it) But eventually it is more a niusanse than something you want to play on regular basis.So resume is that although I did mentioned to my friends about the game but definetely would not recommend to spend this much money (at least to some) on a product that's just basically mocks you instead of delivering proper value for it's worth.,Rust,1,

Do not attempt to play solo if you are on a server with a high population.It s kill on site. Always. The community is definitely toxic. Even if you have pretty much nothing people will just wait outside your door and kill you. It s kinda wild actually. If I want to wait inside my house for hours on end until it s safe.... oh wait I do that already as I m in Canada and it s currently about 33C everyday.....Not really sure how they can fix this for a solo experience... even after a server wipe it seems like groups can get high end gear in the first day... tough to compete with that.****EDIT****I bought this game a long long time ago and it was great.Now....the optimization is terrible.

5362,"2019-02-04",0,0,232,0,1,Though my hours are relatively low I've had this game for a good while now. The vanilla servers are pretty sweet the game is much slower and next to impossible without friends to help you as there are loads of teams working together that will shred your very existence at the drop of a hat.There are loads of modded servers as well that imo are where its at.. A good 5x server with a couple buddies can result in some seriously fun PVP raiding base building etc. The survival side of things is very cool. 100% surviving from other players.. Alliances can be made sure but trust no one in any survival game. Not even your best of friends should be 100% trusted. Lock up everything you want to keep.Graphics are great music is sparse but always nice to hear audio is pretty solid. Voice comms are a little wonky but they are obviously trying to make it proximity to feel more realistic. Buy lots of RAM and an 8gb GPU minimum or you'll regret it ),Rust,1,

However I would only recommend this to someone who's willing to take on the stress and time that this game gives and takes away from u. Rust is a game that takes hours out of your day and it keeps you think on whether or not you're getting raided all day. You will go to sleep thinking about all the hours you put in and how u hope nobody offlines you. But you will probably wake up to being raided. And then you will have to restart all over again and keep going. This is the trust on rust and this is what goes through the average player's mind. And this is why i love it. It keeps me on edge and it's really competitive. The community is what creates the game without all the toxicity and KOS rust wouldn't be rust. And that's why i love/hate it in it's moments.,Rust,1,

5433,"2019-01-14",21,741,30,0,1,I was sad when I finished this game. I don't generally like survival games. This one was different. There was always something spurring you on willing you to go just a little deeper. The crafting wasn't onerous the story was compelling. Wonder and terror at every turn.I'm sorry I won't be able to experience it for the first time again.,Subnautica,1,
5434,"2018-01-01",59,2239,90,1,1,"It's hard to overstate what a magnificent exploration and adventure game Subnautica is.What really stands out to me is that experience not an XP bar but the accumulation of knowledge about the game world its locations and its inhabitants is the most powerful weapon in a player's arsenal.Take Stalkers for example They're the first large predators a player will meet and initially they're annoying and seem quite threatening. An experienced player will ignore them though or at most circle and poke them with a knife to make them go away while at the same time stealing all of their scrap. It helps to have upgraded swim fins upgraded O2 and other advantages but if you took upgraded fins and O2 tanks away from experienced players they still wouldn't have any issues with Stalkers.There's a lot to find and a lot to do in this game. The need to unravel the game's central mysteries and to obtain blueprint fragments salvage and rare materials from wrecks grottoes and strange installations will force you to leave your comfort zone time and again. First you'll crawl out of the Safe Shallows then you'll creep further and deeper then you'll swim further still until one day you'll be amazed at how far away from Lifepod 5 you've gone at the readout on your depth meter and you'll wonder how you ever thought that the seaweed areas just outside of the Safe Shallows were in any way scary.Sustenance is a challenge at first and you'll scramble to get enough food and water but later on they become a matter of management and planning ahead. If you're going on a long expedition you'll want enough supplies to last for the duration but not so many that you can't haul a goodly amount of salvage back to base.As for fiddly stuff you can spend hours building and customizing your underwater habitat customize the look and module loadout of the various vehicles you can build (once you've got the complete blueprints and necessary materials) and have a lot of fun with the wide array of gadgets and Portal/Half Life style ""techno guns"" the game has to offer. There's a lot of meat there but the true meal lies in exploration.Even at the very end of the game though armed with all the technology you've spent hours pulling out of wrecks and scanning (typically while watching your O2 meter like a hawk and listening nervously to that angry predator thrashing around outside) you'll never feel completely safe or at ease. There are great dangers lying in wait and you'd better hope you spot them on your sonar before their sonar catches wind of you....",Subnautica,1,
5435,"2015-04-16",71,1253,726,1,1,I used to be a SCUBA diver. Can't do it anymore. There are days when I miss it all so bad it hurts. The freedom. The solitude. The Unknown... It's all out there hidden beneath the waves. Subnautica is the game I have been waiting for. In a strange way it feeds the sea hunger inside me somehow. Can't quite explain this sensation without having it sound corny and contrived but that's how it works for me.I stumbled onto Subnautica purely by chance while browsing YouTube gaming clips. Ever seen that *one* game that stops you dead in your tracks? I did. Definitely got my attention as I recall. It was an Early Access release so I could expect all kinds of unforeseen digital weirdness happening inside the game itself. My PC's operating specs were a tad on the light side too but it didn't matter. I wanted that game. Badly.I bought it. I played it. I built things and survived. I enjoyed every minute that I spent 'underwater' again. It's an alien ocean on an alien world. Curiously the sights and sounds around you might seem strangely familiar in spite of the bizarre shapes Life has taken in this place. There is indescribable beauty to be found here side by side with terrible dangers that are either innocently disguised or glaringly obvious. It takes a certain mindset to fully appreciate this world as well as considerable restraint to avoid blindly lashing out at every shadow that flits past your facemask. Remember. YOU are the intruder down there. Take a deep breath and immerse yourself completely. Welcome to Subnautica.,Subnautica,1,
5436,"2018-07-23",20,532,60,0,1,To anyone reading this This game is best played COMPLETELY BLIND. Don't watch Let's plays don't read the Subnautica wiki. Just start the game.Game? No. Start your journey.This is hands down the best survival game I've ever played.It's also the only survival game that is not just about collecting ressources and building bases. It has more story &amp lore than all other survival games combined.It's story doesn't begin at the end of the game. It's story starts when you load up the game. It's your story. Not the base building keeps you playing but the exploration and the story drives you further.Drives you deeper.Literally.You push deeper and deeper. And everytime you reach a new area you don't feel welcome. Until you explore the area overcome the obstacles &amp problems there. You have to find out what wants to kill you. From your comfort zone into the wild. You make the unknown your new home. You were afraid first. Now you know what to do.You gather new ressources. They allow you to push even deeper.Rince repeat.You're not welcome.Again.I haven't had this feeling in any other game so far. Pushing into the open not knowing what will happen. Not knowing what to expect.My story playthrough took me 50 hours. I had goosebumps way over 50 times. The atmosphere the whole world the animals you meet. It's a stunning world and you're just a small part of it.No lethal weapons. You're on your own. You're weak. A lone survivor on a strange planet. Then you overcome the challenges build vehicles. Survive adapt overcome.This game is absolutely unique and worth every penny.No this game definitely should not be multiplayer. I am glad it has only singleplayer. You are alone. You feel alone.And when you finally find out the planet's secrets... you will know.,Subnautica,1,
5437,"2018-10-04",0,0,87,0,1,Subnautica is by far the best survival game I have ever played! This game is unlike any survival game. You gather resources and discover technologies to build better and stronger equipment. As you play the game you start to get infected by an alien bacteria. Soon you will find yourself looking for a cure and by doing so you are discovering the misteries of this ocean planet.The visuals are amazing! I couldn't run the game at high settings cuz I only have a gtx1050 but still... WOW! The biomes look spooky and misterious. It just creates this spooky atmosphere.The music is also outstanding! Every biome has its own music. Play with headphones and you will forget about the real world.Then there are the creatures... O man the creatures!The sound design of the creatures is amazing! Just the sound of a reaper in the distance is enough to make me turn around. Not even talking about the gohst leviathan.I strongly recommend EVERYBODY to play this game!Hopefully I haven't spoiled to much about this game!Sorry for bad English. It is not my first language...,Subnautica,1,

5440,"2018-06-11",0,0,64,0,1,Subnautica is quite an experience. I've always been a fan of survival building games and this game can be considered a masterclass in the genre. Everything is very well polished and beautifully designed I have very few gripes about the game. The underwater landscapes are breathtaking and the design of creatures is very inspired. Building the sub known as the cyclops is going to be a gaming moment I never forget. The sheer size the cool factor of the inner workings watching the engine rev up. Such a satisfying progression I'm having a hard time comparing it to any other games.The only negative thing I can think of is that collision detection for entities and walls is not the best at times. I lost a fully upgraded mini sub because it feel into the ground and I could not retrieve it. I would recommend saving often because of a lack of auto save you can just quit and reload if any game breaking bugs happen.Overall subnautica is firmly in my top 5 favourite games. And I will be voting for subnautica GOTY 2018.9.5/10,Subnautica,1,
5441,"2018-11-22",0,0,63,0,1,One of the best survival exploring games I have ever played with a great story. If you like this genre just give it a try. Waiting for Below Zero.,Subnautica,1,
5442,"2018-08-25",0,0,229,0,1,Subnautica...one of the best games I've played in awhile. Great story game play mechanics and graphics. The devs will not be adding any additional content to this because they are now underway with working on a new stand alone game of Subnautica but will continue to work on bug fixes for the game.You receive a lot of information early on to help point you in the right direction to progress as you explore but what's great for me was you still had to take that information and figure out a lot of what had to be done to futher insure your survival in the game.You start out with just some basic items and have to figure out how gain the things needed to create better equipment to survive and explore farther and deeper.....and deeper you can go.The great varity of Biomes and aquatic life is fantastic and the many different things that can and need to be explored creates a great atmosphere of beauty fun stress and fear.Subnautic does not support MP which for me isn't an issue but for those that this might hold back from trying the game I would say they would be missing out on a great experience.If you've thought about trying it but are still on the fence I highly recommend it and say get it.Just an update....Vote Subnautic for STEAM GOTY...I did and it should be.,Subnautica,1,

5444,"2018-11-23",0,0,621,0,1,"(No Spoilers)Subnautica is hands down my best Game of the Year and in my top 3 games I have played in over 25 years of gaming. I absolutely recommend it but be prepared to go on an amazing adventure.This game is immersive and atmospheric absolute beauty matched with moments of terror and humor and a well paced storyline with clues and subplots that lead you into the depths of the game yet let you explore at your own pace. The sounds and music greatly enhance the experience and are a major factor of the game pay attention to the sounds around you! The crafting system is very well done unlocking more levels and enhancements with different areas and just exactly when you need them. Base and vehicle building is also quite well thought out and customization is easy including turning your submarine into a mobile base if you like. Difficulty is also customizable anywhere from permadeath to creative (building without the story). However I would suggest not doing either as your first playthrough. Also as others have said DO NOT watch videos or read guides in your first time through this game. You want to experience it as it was meant to be and you will not get those ""firsts"" back even though it is still very enjoyable to replay (as shown by my hours played). In the end you will find you have been on a wonderful journey engaging your emotions and mind. Do not be surprised to find yourself emotional at the end. It is a compliment to how well the devs have crafted and paced the story and experience. DO watch through the credits at the end though for Alterra's (and the devs) final joke to the player!",Subnautica,1,
5445,"2018-03-15",0,0,59,0,1,Subnautica was a game I initially thought seemed pretty basic at first but it still looked fun. So I had just gotten a decent gaming PC and I see it's on sale. I thought that I might as well give it a try and i'd refund it if I didn't. As soon as I started playing I was hooked I never thought something like this would be so appealing as I would explore new biomes and discover new sealife. The feeling of building your first Seamoth and exploring th deeper parts of the game had me so struck with a sense of acheivement. One thing that I never could have expected from the game is how genuinely terrified I was at times like when I heard a Crabsquid for the first time or when I first discovered what lurks in the dead zone. The graphics are beautiful with a unique style to every creature biome and flora.I have never 1 a game more10/10 would die by Crashfish againEdit Now we just wait for Below Zero,Subnautica,1,

The world is not randomly generated like most survival games. Keep exploring and you will succeed. Wondering what is going on and what to do next is what this game is all about.The game is well balanced and has an astounding atmosphere. Every new discovery gives you a sense of accomplishment that very few games deliver.The only thing that is bad about this game is that it ends. Replay value will be low for most people. It does have a hardcore mode which may not be everyone's cup of tea.Please if you read this review rate. It's not that I care about the ratings I just want people to be aware of potentially ruining their experience by reading spoilers.I am a long time gamer and Subnautica is simply one of the best games I ever played.

5457,"2018-01-27",0,0,63,0,1,I've played this game for a long time in early access. At first it was rough. Not much to do little to create and it lagged something aweful. However from the first iteration of this game to the official launch it has continued to improve and adapt. The lag is still there but very rarely does it affect play there is much more to create and explore and the story has blossomed into a very interesting tale of survival on a beautiful alien world. I am glad this game popped up in my recommendations way back when. As someone who doesn't enjoy survival titles all that much I love this one. 10/10,Subnautica,1,

5462,"2018-10-28",12,305,54,0,1,"One of the best games I ever played.First words that comes to my mind are ""deep immersion"". Developers created a huge beautiful and very realistic world. Subnautica is mainly focused on exploration and it is extremely good. In fact I think that there are no enemies in this game at least I could not perceive any creature as enemy. They are not monsters but just local fauna that live their life in fact they are not even aliens they are at home and you were not invited. There is only one alien on whole planet and this alien is you. Once you learn behaviour of animals you will very rarely encounter any aggression. If for some reason you want to fight... well you may find a prey but bloodshed is absolutely senseless and unnecessary.Game is quite peaceful but it does not mean that there are no dangers in ocean. Pressure lack of oxygen cramped caves limited light... deeper and deeper you went more and more awe you feel. When your submarine hangs over the abyss and you can see nothing but endless cliff and depth... it is scary... well I hardly can remember another game that gave me such intense emotions.World in Subnautica is opened for exploration from the very start you can travel... well everywhere. Still amount of accessable locations is cleverly limited by available technologies. You can try to explore deep caves immediately after planetfall but without supply of oxygen you will just drown. So game softly push player to explore safe shallows first.There is storyline and in my opinion it is very good. I do not want to spoil anything just want to say that storyline is simple but intense yet not intrusive in same time. Bit by bit you will visit all locations and learn all mysteries. Final scene gave me very complex and positive emotions it is beautiful and full of hope with light sadness. It was worth all long way down.Gameplay can be divided into two stages. During first stage you salvage technologies gather resources and craft equipment. There is some grind but I can not say it is boring or tedious... you just explore surroundings and study local life gathering useful items by the way. And second stage is travelling when you gathered enough resources and crafted basic vehicle Seamoth you can explore almost everywhere. There are only three vehicles in game not too much but they are widely customisable. You can install different modules extra armor torpedo launchers defensive electric field and so on also it is available to change appearance of vehicle such as colour and finally you can even give your vehicle a name.You can construct your base that will serve as center of operations. Constructing is simple and effective it is very easy to learn and comfortable to use. There are lot of different modules you can combine and create your awesome station. Even more importantly game offers a lot of different furniture and decorations to customise your base and turn it to... well not just ""a base"" but your home. I really got attached to my tiny but comfortable underwater apartments and my tamed cuddlefish. I really hope that my pets will survive without me... wait it is just a game... *sigh*.Of course I must mention the stunning beauty of Subnautica. Blazing sunsets dense kelp forests impenetrable darkness with sparkles of luminescente flora and fauna... almost every scene literally craves for screenshot. As for sounds and music they are excellent such quality is really impressive. For example I humbly advise you to search for ""Tropical Eden"" melody it creates amazing magical atmosphere I was truly enchanted with.Game is not perfect there are some bugs. Several times I seen fish swimming in my base. Once during exploration of Aurora wreck I got stuck in textures and then suddenly fell out of the world. Well... all this tiny confusing troubles seems insignificant for me.Probably the best advice I can give do not watch videos and do not read guides. Explore by yourself! Believe me pleasure from discovering new things is worth the time. If you love adventure games with main focus on exploration Subnautica is a sure bet. Honestly I do not know any games that can compete with Subnautica in this niche. You do not want to miss this game.",Subnautica,1,

5470,"2017-11-27",0,0,124,1,1,I was hesitant at first about buying this game but after seeing a Let's Play about this I just had to play it (thank you Mark).If you love survival games with a decent crafting system and an interesting story I highly recommend this one.The Story might not be complete yet (at the time of this review) however the game is about to leave Early Access soon.The crafting system is accessed through different machines ingame the first one of which is inside the escape pod that helped you survive the crash. If you want to build a new one elsewhere you have to gather materials first to build a tool that let's you build underwater bases and build a fabricator inside of it. These bases can be build almost anywhere in the huge play area which consists of several different underwater biomes. There are also several underwater vehicles you can craft to explore the ocean (somewhat) safely ) .Also it should be noticed that while this game is not classified as a horror game it can be quite terrifying to be alone in the dark ocean hearing all those strange different noises from all the different alien ocean lifeforms around you and then suddenly a bigger one of them roars right into your ears .A Coop mode was planned for this game from the beginning but the developers decided to focus on the game itself in single player completely and add multiplayer later (probably some time after the full release) so if you want to play this with a friend(s) you'll have to wait a little longer. Otherwise you can enjoy the game as it is right now.The developers stated that this game will not have a multiplayer mode.

This story is present but not in your face the challenges to progress are grindy but in a healthy fashion the graphics are stunning and personally I love just romping about in the water.,Subnautica,1,
5472,"2018-11-22",0,0,62,0,1,I picked up Subnautica from the Humble Freedom Bundle in February 2017. As the game was still in early access I put the game into my backlog list to play when it would be complete.The Good the Bad and the Middle GroundGoodStory the story of Planet 4546B is intriguing. There is just enough lore laying around to make the story of the world enjoyable. Exploring the exploration is top notch and is well paced. Areas/depths are soft locked behind the mod tech level of your submersibles you can push deeper if you want.Atmosphere the atmosphere of the ocean is excellent with each biome having a unique feel.Building building bases around the world is easy and enjoyable except for the high resource cost of some stuff.The Subs both the Seamoth and Cyclops are fun to pilot around. I would have liked the Cyclops or a third larger sub to be a bit more equipped for exploration.Flora and Fauna the plants and creatures of the world are interesting. I would have liked to see a bit more variety in their behaviours. Middle GroundSurvival depending on the game mode you choose you ll get a different experience with having to deal with the survival mechanics. I found the standard survival mode to be a little bit too much of a grind and tied to resource management for my tastes.Docking you can only dock either the Seamoth or the Prawn Suit in the Cyclops not both. In addition I would have liked to have been able to dock the Cyclops to the bases I built. This option would have been especially useful if you could connect the base and the Cyclops s power grid and life support together. BadResource Grind in the standard survival mode I found the grind for resources and the management of your life support to be a bit much. This could have been helped if you had auto collectors that could have been built.Limited Fast Travel in the late game you gain access to a gate network that can take you to some of the biomes. I would have liked a fast travel option that is tied to the bases you built and is accessible much earlier. Leviathan s Tails the tail section of the two late game leviathans you encounter are very similar.Bio mechanicals the Warper is the only bio mechanical creature you ll come across. I d have liked to have seen others and possibly some creatures that were transformed as a result of the Precursor labs. PlaytimeMy leisurely playtime to escape Planet 4546B is about 62 hours.RecommendationThis is a must own if you re into survival exploration atmospheric or base building games. If you don t like survival mechanics or much of a grind I d encourage you to go with either freedom or creative mode. Thank you Unknown Worlds Entertainment for creating a great exploration game with a great atmosphere.,Subnautica,1,

Fun game the building part is fun resource hunting can be tedious enemies can be infuriating (more so since the latest updates added the ""teleporting claw your eyeballs out nope"" and the ""gigantic omg it shoots fireballs at your face nope"".) Placement of some of the tech items is absurd but with practice and a monstrous amount of planning and patience they can be obtained. True the game has gotten substantially harder over updates but for the atmosphere gameplay and especially the graphics I can still honestly recommend this title. I would however suggest tying to grab it on a sale though.Edit 1 Ok so since the addition of new content I cannot praise the game enough. The way the story has been implemented into the survival mechanics has really polished the game. The biomes have been smoothed out and look fantastic the sense of dread passed 500 meters compounded with the atmospheric sounds had me at pucker factor 9000 all the time.

5487,"2015-12-26",114,766,217,1,1,Everyone talks about how it's early access bugs blah blah blah. If you're reading this review you know about all that. I recently realized I am a huge fan of survival sandbox games and I have played quite a few in the last months. Here is my personal impression of this one.Graphics are incredible. I know everyone has said this but it needs repeating. On the lowest settings it still looks awesome! Some clipping and such but it never really bothered me much.It's very fluid (no pun intended) to get into it. I agree with most other reviews that recommend no using guides and such and just jump into the deep water (pun intended) and learn to swim on your own. It's a very friendly interface that gives just enough explanation to make you feel like you can do it on your own but not enough to make it boring.Edit I forgot the most important part (to me at least.) The metabolism for food in this game is very nice. In plenty of other games like this you have to eat every two minutes or face death from starvation. In this game keeping hydrated is the issue. While this is rather ironic while being surrounded by water it makes a lot more sense. I get away with eating once every day or two depending on my activity. Dehydration keeps me drinking daily but not constantly. Considering dehydration kills you faster than starvation I feel this is the most realistic representation I have seen in one of these games thus far. Here is what any new player needs to know Expect it will hurt you until you prove to yourself that it can't. Explore. Even the dark and scary areas. They usually have the best loot.Storage cubes cannot be used indoors (as of the writing of this review.)Predators are everywhere and you are not one of them. If it can eat you it will.If it can eat you it's usually in a scary area.You WILL get snuck up on and jumpscared. Give it at least an hour before you start looking up stuff online and once you do do it very sparingly. Discovery is an awesome feature to this game and the more you have to figure out the more valuable this game will be.,Subnautica,1,
5488,"2018-11-19",0,0,76,0,1,Played this game quite a few times and to be honest I play with cheats sometimes because the animals scare me. On a different note The game does it's job at immersing you into the story you aren't playing the main character because you ARE the main character. Their silence is your voice and that is something not alot of games can do. Something that impressed me was the fact that this game brings out your instincts as if you are in REAL mortal danger for me there was alot of looking over my shoulder both ingame and real life. In a way this game shapes you at the same time it gives you opportunities to shape it.,Subnautica,1,

5497,"2016-02-18",42,708,399,0,1,After 41 hours I feel like I'm ready to say my piece about this game. It's important to specify that I'm playing in survival mode where you have to constantly worry about food and water. The game will be very different depending on which mode you play because in the sandbox mode you can freely build and explore without ever having to stop what you're doing to gather nourishment. In hardcore you have to be extra careful because once you die you have to start over. At this point I'm glad I did not pick hardcore because there are ways you can die that just aren't forseeable. There also occasional bug in the game which results in your death like the all too common diving reel malfunctions.First Impressions This game is amazing. That can be and is said about many games. But there is nothing like Subnautica. I had been waiting for 19 years ever since playing the crap out of the incredibly immersive fun but ultimately flawed Sub Culture. Finally we have a game that surpasses Sub Culture in every aspect except the storyline. With that said Subnautica has flaws.The Bad In all it's glory there are a few nags some of which make the game increasingly difficult as you get further into the game. First I'm going to get it out of the way that there is a startup bug that made me almost request a refund even before getting into the game. Subnautica doesn't always start because the game menu screen frequently refuses to fully load. This is probably some sort of GPU initialization issue that prevents the graphics from displaying properly. In any event I have to exit out of the game and restart it in Window mode to get the game to finish loading at all.Also The learning curve is very steep. There are no instructions for anything and the information given on any device in the crafting menus tell you nothing worthwhile about what stuff does. There are some basic descriptions but they're very poor. For example the current generator says it generates current. When I started playing I had no idea what I would want to create a current for.The third thing is the max depth of the in game vehicles. There is much debate about the actual depth of the game. Some say it goes on forever. Others have quoted that the game crashes out at 60 000 meters. Some have said 20 000 meters. Others have said there is a secret world in the greatest depths which sounds pretty epic. In any event. The ocean goes deeper than I feel comfortable thinking about. The problem here lies in the fact that the vehicles seem to have a max depth of 200 meters. (I've since found the Cyclops can go to approximately 900 meters at the expense of power efficiency. I believe the Seamoth can also go to a comparable depth.)Fourth the hunger and thirst meters drop far too quickly. This seems nitpicky when you consider I did pick the survival mode but the problem with this system is that you have to spend hunger and thirst to find food that becomes increasily more difficult to find as the game goes on. As a result you might find yourself spending almost half your time gathering food and supplies to make water. Which leads me to the next problem in the game.Fifth scarcity of food and supplies for making water. At first everything is plentiful and readily available. Salt while a challenge to find when you don't know what you're looking for seems to respawn readily and limitlessly. Coral while seemingly limitless at first begins to disappear rapidly after many hours of gameplay. Moreover I have seen no indication that it respawns. Food which pretty much comes from the natural fish stocks can disappear amazingly fast from an area. After 41 hours of gaming I have effectively cleared all of the initial shallows of the ocean plus the surrounding depths of fish. It's amazing how fast they diminish. The only solution seems to be to put respawning or faster reproduction of the fish in the game. I have not seen any indication that the fish respawn at all which seems clear by some of the dead zones I have in my current save. There are some pretty heated debates about this in the discussion groups. Naysayers claim the supplies are unlimited and all you have to do is look further. My answer to that is that you begin to spend a lot more thirst and food meter energy and other resources to find food. Because of this there is a rapidly diminishing return on the value of food and water in the game. The devs claim it causes people to explore more. I'm not satisfied with that response because the reality is this if people have no motivation to explore. If they just stick to the shallows and eat and drink they aren't going to have the attention span to stick with the game for the long term anyway. Apparently a fix is being tested in the experimental mode but it's coming all too slow to a stable build.Sixth and my final gripe and this is definitely as glaring as the fifth scarcity of resources. Copper Quartz Acid Mushrooms are plentiful at first but become ridiculously difficult to come by as the game goes on. Quartz is practically used in everything because you need it for glass and rubber which you need for building and making Power Cells to power your vehicles. Each Power Cell takes a vast amount of resources which would not be as much of a problem if they didn't deplete so rapidly. Even with the power efficiency mod only a small expedition can use 6 power cells and leave you scrambling for resources. Many users have defaulted to the same argument they have given to the food shortage problem that there's plenty in the depths. The problem is that it takes more and more energy food and water to farm this stuff. You end up trapped in a cycle of more and more rapidly diminishing marginal utility on all of your resources. This really needs to be fixed or users will basically be driven out of their own game by scarcity. Both of the last two problems have people vehemently defending the current scarcity with the argument that resources are scarce in real life. I would like to point out however that one person alone in a wilderness does not leave vast expanses of land void of any life. Certainly these rich biomes should be able to support just one person. Also if the player were able to hunt for shellfish and crustaceans in the game diversity of foods might help lower depletion rates. The player should be able to find oysters and dig for clams. The Good Based on my criticisms some might get the idea that I don't like the game. That couldn't be more wrong. Subnautica is hands down simply the best underwater game ever made. There's no competition. The environment is rich full of wonder and among the most immersive games I've ever played. The world is packed full of fascinating creatures beautiful vegetation and unparalleled undersea effects. The graphics are complimented by some of the most incredible sound you could possibly imagine. All of it adds up to a game that makes you feel like you're living rather than playing.It's one of those games that comes along and really changes things forever at least among those who have played it. In my opinion the game hasn't gotten nearly the recognition it deserves. The amount of stuff you can do in this game and the painstaking attention to detail are mindblowing. Those are things I hope never change with Subnautica. Many early access games are dumbed down in later iterations. Unknown Worlds Entertainment seems to have a good attitude about adding new features instead of taking them out like some other developers of early access releases have done in the past. I just hope they maintain the trend.Subnautica is an oustanding game worth its price about three times over. It comes with my highest recommendation. In it's current state I would give Subnautica a 9/10.Added 11/23/17 The game has been hugely updated since this review.,Subnautica,1,
5498,"2016-08-02",0,0,165,1,1,Definately a game to blow some time on if you just feel like derping around. Yes it does get boring after a while but you can find ways to make it interesting like make a garden collect eggs and raise 100 stalkers go to the dunes or aurora and crap your pants by being attacked by reapers shock the reapers and make them cry build a huge base for no reason build an island with the terraformer or explore. In my opinnion Id say this game is horror and adventure its horrifying when you get eaten alive by a reaper or watch a crabsquid or crabsnake wander around (crabsnakes being a bit more majestic than a 14 legged freak). The game might not have alot of potential just yet but things like (im not saying the name of the race) alien bases and alien abominations are definately going to spice this game up.Yes the monthly updates might not be the most exciting but quite a few add interesting concepts like the chargers those definately allow you to save a few resources by charging your depleted cells and batteries where before these were added you would have to craft new ones. Summary an interesting game with a lot of possible potential not reccommended if you easily stress out because some creatures will latch on to you/grab you to kill you (i think i set the record for the number of yous in a single sentence) because like me i feel like im going to have a heart attack 1 if you do like changing your pants alot and feel like building some crazy base.,Subnautica,1,

I may spoil some stuff in this review so please play this game it is so much better to experience all of this first hand. Anyway without further ado let us get into the review.The PositivesThere is so much that this game gets right that it is hard to sum up in a quick review. The visuals are stunning beautiful water effects the world feels so alive. The sound design is immaculate from the reefbacks to the squids they all sound spot on. The content is amazing with all locations in the map distinct and offering something completely new. The creativity and customization regarding your base locations are unique to any other survival game I have ever played. The equipment is weak but effective not making all the monsters seem powerless and still posing a threat to the player.The NegativesThere is honestly not much to say. One point I could bring up is how difficult it is to find parts and blueprints for equipment. Through my game I had to result in searching up where to find particular parts because it was taking me so long to find just one part. Another point to possibly bring up is the lack in developer updates. To my knowledge Unknown Worlds is currently working on a new expansion but besides that they haven't really added anything to the game.In conclusion I really enjoyed this game and would recommend it to anyone. This gets a 10/10 for me. A truly perfect survival experience.,Subnautica,1,

5522,"2018-11-21",0,0,21,0,1,DISCLAIMER This review has been created for the autumn sale badge primarily. Its content is valid nontheless.I've only got some 20 something hours under my belt but I've been following and (back then only occasionally) playing Subnautica since its early stages of early access.First things first the developer did in fact deliver on the promises they made. The game has been in development for quite a while and the full release is a breathtaking piece o' art in my opinion. The environment(s) are captured beautifully as f* k. The world that you're exploring screams for you to keep going further since it seems there's always something new right around the coral (I'll never forget my first time discovering the glowing mushroom caves!).One thing for the single players among you Subnautica is single player only and it's unexpectedly great at it. It may be a survival game with all the classic survival elements (that to many screams for multi player) but it is well thought out and does in fact have a story that you're playing through.The game mechanics are pretty straightforward. A decluttered UI and easy controls add to the great accessibility of the game. The only actual issue I find myself having is that sometimes objects are being rendered quite late and thus popping up out of nowhere. Might be that's due to a rather short detail drawing distance/LOD stuff? Dunno... I can only speak for myself of course but I can live with that pretty well.The best part though that made me grin all over my face (warning contains spoilers for new players) Getting ripped apart by a reaper leviathan for the first time gave me massive chills. The same uneasy gut feeling you have when you wake from a nightmare. That alone is an example of fantastic staging and scripting. It's rather rare that a game can make you feel like that nowadays without the use of jump scares or the likes.TL DR Subnautica is an aesthetically more than pleasing game within a world full of surprises and a load to see. The story is in fact rather interesting the more you get into it.,Subnautica,1,
5523,"2016-11-24",0,0,97,0,1,Not since Morrowind has a game captivated me so with its setting and ecosystem. It does justice to the oversaturated survival crafting subgenre and shines as an example on how to do Early Access well.

My only regret is that I can never play it for the first time again (but this hasn't stopped me from replaying it anyway).,Subnautica,1,
5526,"2018-07-07",0,0,213,0,1,I have played plenty of games in my time but this is by far the best. It has such a sense of eploration and a magical and mysterious aura around it. You can survive you can explore you can learn and you can build. I highly recommend it. But the thing I love the most is going deep. Down there is so much different to the surface. Monstorous creatures beautiful sights and scary places. Im going to be honest some siduations can be terrifing. And at times I have sworn its more of a horrer game. I love this game 9999999/10.,Subnautica,1,

5531,"2016-11-27",0,0,124,0,1,If you love survival games then this one will be for you.+ great atmosphere+ great overal sounds+ easy building tools+ great graphics+good storyline ( wich is still under construction )Its not the most easy game in terms of looking around for your blueprints on how to build stuff.So far that i can see there is no ingame map but wich can be solved by placing beacons around.Its still under development so sometimes it might crash ( at least it does with me ) so saving alot can help )But there is lots to do and build and explore already.Really nice game i hope more people will buy the game so it can be finished .,Subnautica,1,
5532,"2015-02-07",0,0,79,0,1,Being that this is an early access game i cant say its 100% at this point in time (Im not meaning completed Im meaning as a score)For its current state though it is quite amazing and graphically eye catching with its bright mix of colour.Pretty much a ocean survival game not much else to it.You swim around collecting resources so you can gradually build (and name) your own submarine known as the CyclopsOnce you have that the vast oceans of this alien world are yours to explore.. on saying that though there really isnt much to do at this point.. I guess you could go explore the depths in your mini sub (the Seamoth which can also dock inside your Cyclops) and avoid the many sea creatures that are able to attack you (there is also many that are neutral) but there really isnt much to do and after a few hours of gameplay it may get a bit boring for some.Personally i love it.. Its good to play an ocean exploring submarine game rather then the usual FPS or any other mainstream game out there.Yes theres bugs and glitches and some can be quite annoying but the console commands assist alot though.In all if your willing to assist the dev's in progressing this game and love exploring alien ocean depths then yeh i recomend this game.If you wanting more content and greater activities then i guess its best you wait this one out for a while.*Update* Just buy it!

5544,"2018-11-11",0,0,98,0,1,Despite having quite the fear of deep ocean I find myself inexplicably drawn to the simplicity of the mechanics in this game as well as the complexity of what you can make it. The crafting is flawless and is easy to understand and leaves room for you to build whatever kind of base you want. The exploration is excellent as each new area has multitudes of creatures hostile or passive alike and many resources and hidden secrets that make this game a fantastic all around experience that captures the beauty of this foreign ocean planet as well as the ferocity and fear of the unknown that lies in store. If you're looking for a game that is immersive and exciting as well as fear inducing and awe inspiring do yourself a favor and buy this game and experience all of this for yourself.,Subnautica,1,

5547,"2016-06-16",0,0,478,1,1,Don't let the early access scare you away. To me there was enough of a game here to be worth more than the 20 dollarsI can say right now the best aspect about this game is the exploration aspect. This has to be the best representation of an explorable ocean in any game I've seen. Its an alien ocean too. Its huge scary deep and full of things that want to murder you. Oh yeah that's the neat thing. The ocean can get REALLY deep. Try looking down while wading water and not being able to see the bottom until you go very far down. It can be terrifying.There is a huge variety of ocean biomes to explore with colorful (or dull depending on what biome you're in) flora and fauna in them ranging from underground caverns with pink jellyfish mushrooms wastelandic dunes coral reefs kelp forests and crashed remnants of the ship you fell down from and more.As someone who's terrified of open water this game was a really cool experience. The deep water and alien life really captures the vastness of the ocean and the scary unknown things that dwell in it.,Subnautica,1,

5558,"2018-06-18",0,0,316,0,1,I have been with this game since its Alpha stage (I think if not a little later then that stage). After the full game came out a while ago it took me weeks to beat it. I remember everytime their was a big update to the game I would have to restart the whole game. I did taht untill just a while ago when (again) the full game came out. This has been one of 3 things that kept me playing Steam. This was my very first story mode game. To the Creators of Unknown Worlds I would like to thank you for being the reason for staying on Steam. I have had so much fun times on here. I would also like to congratulate you on this game. This game is just like a baby and I am a person growing up with it. I have watched this game go from being just a small little game with low graphics develop over time get bigger more well known to being a full game with awesome graphics good detail awesome voice actors unique story plot and of course badass music. I love this game so much I was willing to spend $160 on a better graphics card (I think it was) just to play this game. The weird part is I hate the ocean in real life but I was willing to play this game to help me overcome that fear. It didn't really help. So I would recomend this game to anyone who is afriad of the ocean and wants to scare themselfs. Again Unknown Worlds I would like to thank you and congratulate you on this awesome game. P.S. I will spend any amount of money to get the DLC next year.,Subnautica,1,

5573,"2018-10-17",0,0,73,0,1,I don't normally write reviews. Quite frankly I feel a game should be pretty good at the least as you bloody well paid for it. But this is a lot more than good it's awesome. The story starts off simple which is good. I like Commando. Arnie killing lots of people. Simple is good. It's really great fun scavenging and learning the tech tree at first to break you in. I was expecting the game to then peter out after a couple of hours but it just didn't. It got more and more engaging and had me absolutely hooked. The story structure and attention to detail is fantastic. I was lucky enough to play this in VR on the Vive and although the detailed graphics are boarderline fuzzy/horrible (trying to see your inventory panel) the immersion reminded me of when I did my PADI licence and it really made me feel like I was tootling about underwater. I started holding my breath when I was running out of air for heaven's sake! Anyway...buy this please especially if you have a Vive. Next to Arizona Sunshine this is one of those VR defining titles for me and made me glad I paid for it the whole VR thing.

5577,"2016-07-01",0,0,153,1,1,"Currently (as of 7/1/16) a clear example of an ""early access"" title that is both enjoyable AND replayable.The Devs are both responsive to their player base and creative indicating that they want to see this game to a ver.1 when it's actually done. My hope is that they don't lose interest too soon and patch it up in order to move on like so many other titles.Around once a month a new patch hits the stable build that changes things so much that players are persuaded to start a new game. And I don't mind a bit! Each new build repairs critical bugs adds new content and improves upon elements that were already interesting enough to inspire players to imagine even more ideas for the direction of the game.The true energy for growth in this title comes from a masterfully orchestrated suggestion function/bug reporter combined with a development blog that reports to players exactly the progress that participant Devs are making towards implementation of said improvements. This system for development does wonders to stem the inevitable tide of criticism that comes from players that typically feel disconnected from the process.Game is worth it in its current state $11.99 summer sale.

5581,"2018-11-27",0,0,124,0,1,"TL DRWith a personal rating of ""S "" Subnautica brilliantly blends the abysmal possibilities of deep space ocean life into a survival game about the exciting yet menacing exploration of the unknown.Basic info.Genre Action Adventure (Survival) AdventureTheme Sci fi Aliens UnderwaterPlayer type Single playerPerspective First personSummarySubnautica follows the story of a spacecraft s crash on the hostile underwater world of the uncharted Planet 4546B in the late 22nd century. Specifically it follows the struggles of one of the survivors who descends into the ocean exploring and learning about the alien environment and its habitants in order to gather resources craft items and maybe find a way home.Main analysis Overall score 91 100 Rating S Story15 15Universe Outstanding Subnautica takes place in the fictional Planet 4546B which is almost completely covered in water. Aurora crash landed on the planet luckily on a guyot (namely the Crater) that houses a variety of miniature ecosystems. Each of these biomes contains its distinctive set of flora and fauna to discover and resources to harvest. More specifically ranging from the busy coral reefs of the Safe Shallows to the deadly red and white forests of the Blood Kelp Zones and from the hypnotizing Jellyshroom Cave to the blazing Lava Lakes the Crater s biomes are diverse unforgettably original and awe inspiring. In addition being an outstanding base building game Subnautica allows the creation of compartmentalized habitats progressively flourishing into true palaces. Eventually the protagonist may also explore Aurora s crash site and other abandoned bases and facilities.Characters Impressive Despite the plethora of data downloads that can be found among the wrecks the protagonist doesn t encounter any other survivors which results in an even more horrifying atmosphere. The player is forced to explore the ocean as well as encouraged to seek companion among the native fauna (or flora). From a biological perspective Subnautica s biodiversity is impressive and its lifeforms are carefully designed to reflect their evolutionary adaptions. Planet 4546B is a breathing and breathtaking world where one can witness the organisms complex relationships as they develop.Plot Intriguing The game s multidimensional narrative unravels in accordance with the player s pace of exploring as it takes place in a non linear open world environment filled with wonders and threats to discover. The main story line has a classic 3 act structure (setup confrontation resolution) and it includes several side stories. Spoilers aside discovering the history of Planet 4546B is truly fascinating and intriguing. Notably the player is equipped with a PDA a multipurpose device which among others contains a data bank aimed at documenting their journey s logs.Artistic work18 20Graphics / Visuals Captivating Planet 4546B s beauty is colorful vibrant and vivid the wild biomes are refreshing and visually stunning even the intruding technological advancements grace upon this aquatic paradise.Cinematics Bad Subnautica s cut scenes are disappointingly few short and seamlessly integrated into the gameplay.Soundtrack Enchanting Being an established sci fi themed title Subnautica s futuristic soundtrack contains songs that eerily etch the mystery and the horror of the unknown and of what lurks within it the curiosity of exploration and the thrill of discovery deep into one s soul. During their staying on Planet 4546B the player is accompanied by electronic music that stimulates the feelings of loneliness and homesickness yet strengthens and replenishes their hope and will for survival.Audio Great The game s audio successfully vitalizes its creatures rendering them acoustically identifiable as well as either cuter or more horrifying. All in all it contributes to the ambience by creating the ultimate subaquatic experience.Voice acting Great Despite the lack of NPCs the player may collect voice logs and come across radio messages which include immersive performances. On the other hand the player is always accompanied by the voice of his trustful PDA s AI (and occasionally the ones of his vehicles AIs). Finally the telepathic contact with the Sea Emperor Leviathan is mesmerizing.Gameplay12 15Modes Good There are 4 modes (Survival Freedom Hardcore Creative) with different restrictions on gameplay. They define the requirements for survival (as far as the player s needs are concerned) and the number of available lives.Extras Great Duration Extremely long Replayability Incredible Difficulty Not adjustable Grindy The game has a standard level of difficulty (depending on the chosen mode) and requires hours of farming for resources. The player is advised to read the PDA s guides and tutorials.Technical work17 20Mechanics Hooking In order to survive the player must keep their health above 0 while covering their basic needs for oxygen food &amp water by any means necessary. In the meantime they re called to avoid radiation and extreme temperatures as well as defend themselves against any dangerous life forms. The quest for survival is fortunately facilitated by a complex crafting system that provides the player with cutting edge equipment tools vehicles Seabases etc. Furthermore base building feels addictive as it involves the full customization of interiors.Controls OK The limiting 5 slotted toolbar in combination with the lack of hotkeys for essential items (such as the Scanner and the Seaglide) forces the player to periodically spam the PDA in order to access unbound items in the storage and perform basic functions (heal eat drink etc) which is inconvenient and frustrating especially when it s a matter of life and death. Sooner or later the player gets used to driving the game s vehicles and can navigate their way around with ease but till then there s plenty of bumping to put up with.Functionality Good Having spent 3+ years in Steam s Early Access Subnautica is almost bug free. There are occurrences of glitching AI now and then (e.g. models harmlessly passing through the player s base) but since the game s release I haven t encountered any game breaking bugs.Menu Options File size Reasonably big Misc.10 10Development Great Community Great Personal experience19 20Version 3.0.0.",Subnautica,1,

5590,"2018-01-30",0,0,83,0,1,"&gt Built a yellow Seamoth Sub and named it ""Newt""&gt Built a yellow Prawn Suit and named it ""Ripley""Just waiting for an opportunity to shout ""GET AWAY FROM HER YOU BIIIIITCH!!!!""This is actually a really good game that I have been binge playing for the past few days. Incredible atmosphere great game design and progression system. Intensely engrossing. Overall fairly solid with no crashes although there is the occasional bit of frame dropping when I enter a vehicle or breach the surface of the water.The only thing that makes me stop playing is the sudden realization that I've gone wayyyyy past my bedtime and I'm starving for some real life food. There's very few games that ever do that to me and very few things in life that do that to me as well. Subnautica is like a gripping novel you just can't put down or a suspenseful movie you just can't turn away from but it's also an epic journey and the more you play it the more you WANT to play it.So yes it has a good story. It also has good gameplay. In some ways it borrows from games like Metroid in that you MUST upgrade your gear in order to reach certain places like reinforcing your submersible so that it can descend further. But it also blends that with games like Amnesia where the needed blueprints are in a *really scary hulking wreckage thru a hole that your sub won't fit thru so you better get to swimming...* It's got ATMOSPHERE! LOADS OF IT!And all of the little tidbits of audio from the Alterra Corp. AI that talk to you through your helmet audio paint a little bit of wry humour just to break the scariness a bit and the game loop of going back and forth between the bright safety of your undersea base and some truly terrifying and inky depths just keeps you from getting used to how scary AND beautiful Subnautica is. There are some truly gorgeous things to be seen in this game and the handcrafted locations feel like just that HANDCRAFTED AND UNIQUE and NOT copypasted and bland!In terms of lethal weapons you have your survival knife and you can manufacture nerve gas torpedoes. The former is more of a tool though you can use it to fend off smaller parasites and nibblers and secure food and the latter is reasonably effective against anything that isn't Leviathan class. You're neither at the bottom of the food chain nor the apex predator but when you have to craft your own torpedoes you probably won't feel inclined to fire them for any other reason besides self preservation. All the aggressive species are inedible and provide no usable materials so your best bet is to avoid them as much as possible. Besides even if you kill one the sea has a limitless supply of them.But in terms of other gadgets and tools the Stasis Gun is going to be the one that gets you out of a pinch the most because it works on almost everything and it's the best tool for securing food AND for holding the most unsettling creatures in place while you either swim the hell away or get a scan and then swim the hell away.And all the crafting and customization of your undersea habitat feels really well thought out. You don't *have* to go and make a big aquarium and populate it with creature eggs gathered from the depths but after you come back from a terrifying dive after being chased by giant spooky beasts you are going to think about sprucing up the place while your terror subsides and you can work up the courage to go back there because you left early because you ran out of food or storage space because the spooky place had all this great loot back there.C'MON WHAT MORE DO I HAVE TO EXPLAIN?!?!

I never played the beta I never saw anyone else play it. I just saw it on sale bought it because it looked good and started to play it blind. I stopped playing for a couple of months because I did not know what else to do. I started playing it again because I saw some gameplay and wanted to play it again. In the past week and a half I built my first base seamoth prawn suit seaglide and cyclops because I did a lot of googling. I spent most of the game swimming around without any of that stuff and dying a lot. So what I ask the developers is to put in more objective descriptions for the people who have never heard of this game before or is new to these types of games. I still have not beat this game yet.,Subnautica,1,

It gets me on every level of fear that I have the ocean the unknown darkness loud alien etc. But I can't stop playing it.

I've been playing it a lot recently and I just started exploring because I used to be too timid to (for some reason?). I've been venturing out and I love it! So so so so much!!! It's perfect for me because I love 'scary' stuff but its not as scary as some things that give me nightmares over all I recommend subnautica.

If you've ever wanted to play a survival game but always dreaded the greving this is the game for you. I highly recommend NOT using wikis or videos or at least using the wiki the least ammount possible half the fun is uncovering the story yourself. I know it sounds tedious but it's not and it's highly rewarding.,Subnautica,1,

5617,"2018-03-23",0,0,52,0,1,Product received for free. A masterpiece. This game is incredible a real experience. It has stirred emotion in me unlike any game has done in a long time.What Subnautica does is truly unique. Subnautica stands you on an alien ocean planet. It dares you to survive and tricks you with its illusions of safey. Truly the best advice I can give to any new player (which I recieved myself) is to play this game guideless. Dive in with both feet and survive. Figure it out on your own. Leave the guides and tips till later and let the game teach you.But aside from all of this the thing that Subnautica does the best is this Subnautica gives players the means to build the perfect ocean base and research facility. It seduces you with its habitat customizations posters cuddly toys (and fish) potted plants and furniture. It does this so well that you'll forget you were even planning to leave.And that's what makes the final step in this game so much harder. This game excels at creating an emotional bond between player and experience and then forces you to say a heartfelt 'Goodbye!' and leave it all behind for home.So goodbye for now Planet 4546B.I'll be coming back to do it all again in future. Thanks Unknown Worlds!,Subnautica,1,

5623,"2018-02-02",0,0,28,0,1,"Let me just start off by saying this game is easily one of my favourite games ever made and easily the best survival game on steam The visuals and the sounds are top notch they set up the atmosphere spectacularly and really immerse you in this beautiful world. Every biome every cave cavern and whatever else you come across feels and looks incredible and unique.My one gripe with the visuals is that there are some poppup issues the game engine seems to have a hard time with that but the quality of said visuals easily makes up for it. Exploration is easily one of the best parts of this game. Terror mixed with bliss as you go deeper and deeper into the depths of planet 4546B fills your every nervous breath as you watch your oxygen tank slowly deplete while simultaneously listening in a boot shaking fashion to the sea monsters roaring and swimming around you. I swear sometimes this game is a horror game in disguise.Subnautica being a survival exploration game you wouldn't expect much if any story. Subnautica once agains exceeds your expectations by delivering an incredibly well linked together and presented story. The deeper you get into the game the more the story and the lore of this planet reveals itself to you through readable PDAs exploration and astonishingly good voice acting. You slowly start making sense of the rubble steadily uncovering every secret this planet has. ""Why did the Aurora crash?"" or ""Why is that bizzare creature even for this alien planet so hell bent on killing me?"" or ""What happened to all the Aurora survivors?"" you get answers to all of them.There is a whole spectrum of different fauna and flora for you to discover and learn about some harmless others scaring the sh*t out of you to the point where you wish their whole species went extinct. At no point in this game do you ever get lethal weaponry which really helps with the whole setting of you never being the apex predator the ocean is your apex predator.Something I stole from someone elses review but is cool nonetheless ""There is a sense of wonder and danger present in this game that I haven't found in other similar titles. The light fades the deeper you go and sometimes all you can see is a limited field in front of you. That doesn't mean you don't hear everything. ""The devs of Subnauta are unbelievably devoted to this game. Subnautica was released on early access 3 years ago. Back then it was more of an idea than a functional game. The graphics looked like crap and the game was very underdevelopped. On multiple occasions the devs almost went bankprunt but luckily for them the game was brought to light by youtubers and twitch streamers who helped foster a community for the game and helped the game prosper. After funding for the game started getting some traction the dev team went beast mode and started pumping out update after update and made the development progress easily accessible to anyone through the trello where they released logs and images of the whole thing. Thank you Unknown Worlds Entraintenment ( hehe studio name matches the game ) for making this game a reality. Conclusion This game is an absolute masterpiece in every sense of the word and should be experienced by every single person who has the ability to do so.Visuals 4/5 because of the poppup issues the graphical design itself is astonishingSounds 5/5 simply top notchImmersion 5/5 got hooked for 6 days until I finished the gameExploration/gameplay 5/5 Story and lore 4.5/5 very good for any game but especially for a survival gameHUD and player menus 5/5 practical and stylishLenght and price 5/5 I followed the game fanatically during early access meaning I knew exactly how to progress and where everything was located and it still took me 27 hours. 27 hours of pure enjoyment for 23 euro.Overall 9.5/10 Just buy it already have I not praised it enough ?",Subnautica,1,

I finished the game in about 2 weeks of off and on gameplay using a few wiki pages to find some of the fragments for the tools and find quicker ways into the lost river/lava zones. If you went through the game completly blind not having watched anyone play the game or use wiki pages (I did both) it would easily take you another 20ish hours to finish the story AND you would have a ton of fun in sandbox exploring all the different areas of the game.

Vehicles handle well (except when they're not supposed to) and they each have their advantages and disadvantages that balance each other out.It actually took until my third playthrough before I realized that some of the logfiles you can find in the world have audio that can be played and that made it even that much better!All in all I heartily recommend this game to anyone.

5636,"2018-08-08",0,0,66,0,1,Subnautica is potentially the best survival horror game I've ever played that's not even labeled as a horror game. You start off the game as a survivor from a ship called the Aurora and your primary goal is obviously survival. You constantly have to keep an eye on your food and water meter (unless you're not playing survival mode) alongside your oxygen and health. And if that's not enough to keep you on your fins soon you find out there's fish so big you never want to see them more than once. Subnautica also has a very interesting story that I will not spoil here for those who haven't played the game yet.So now that the basics are out of the way let's review the positives and negatives about the game PROS A huge oceanic environment with many different biomes to explore all containing different fauna and flora. A touching story that will make you sympathetic towards a massive aquatic species. Three interesting vehicles that are mostly fun to operate and integral to your survival. Dozens of different blueprints scattered around the biomes leading to useful equipment. Potential fish friends! Contains the most terrifying area in any game ever (also known as Crater's Edge).CONS Is a bit buggy at times. It can also be a bit laggy.Overall? 9.8/10! Subnautica is probably one of the best games I have played in a while and I'll be looking forward to the Arctic biome DLC.,Subnautica,1,
5637,"2017-09-02",0,0,320,1,1,This game is early access but it is AMAZING!I love The Immersion! It really sucks you in. The Graphics and detail are great! Salvaging Crafting Building Exploring Surviving BluePrints with risk for reward mechanic That moment where your computer A.I. talks and puts you at ease with its calm voice just to get jump scared a moment later by some random aquatic creature because you think your actually are struggling to survive!I truly expect this game to be my favorite game for a long time. Even though its not finished it is only an update or two away from being a complete story.I do however want the bugs fixed. Especially immersion killing ones. I notice everything especially the difference between a normal battery and an upgraded one in the charger having the same mesh. My cyclops not healing all the way once when I patched the hull (Related to being hit by a Ghost L********). Jumping on my cyclops with my prawn sends it 138 000m down into nowhare through all the terrain and still hearing the ai screaming about it being below crush depth. Causes me to reload my last save. Lastly the performance on some areas causing the game to stall for a bit while it thinks not rendering items occasionally fast enough and all performance hit items related to this should be addressed. This will only add to the games value and for me that oh so great immersion.I fully expect the team to fix these things and have a well polished game in the end. They are completely open about development to the public and have a trello page that you can follow to see exactly what is going on right this moment in its progression.I give it a 8 / 10 now and feel it will be a 10 / 10 game by the end of its developement.IMO this game is a must have! I say get it. I believe the price will be going up at release (They will then likely also put it on sale to make you feel your getting a deal) and you will only have done your wallet a diservice to not have grabbed it sooner.ENJOY!!!!,Subnautica,1,

I have a 1.8 ghz processor 6 gigs ram and ATI Radeon 5400 graphics card and it runs ok on minimum graphics.It's unique. Doesn't need much explanation it's an underwater survival game pretty nice.Lots of content you can build underwater bases submarines and much more in a brilliant crafting system.Overall I highly recommend this game well worth 15!,Subnautica,1,

5643,"2018-11-25",0,0,32,0,1,"Subnautica is one of the best games I've ever played I can't recommend it enough.Normally the tags ""Survival"" ""Open World"" ""Exploration"" and ""Crafting"" turn me away immediately because I've spent so much time in Minecraft and these kinds of games are a dime a dozen. Subnautica is absolutely anything but. Immersion is a term used a lot in games but Subnautica pulled me underwater and into the game so well. The environment is beautiful the sound design is extremely well done and the story is... something I hope you get to experience without any spoilers. I was entirely blind sided by the moments this game brought about. Story is difficult in an open world because you might just miss some content but the developers made a system that led you to everything you need to.The survival aspect of the game is fun as well. As I said I've played a lot of Minecraft and other survival games so the genre feels very grindy to me now. This game's world drew me in to ignore any gripes with that and... made me actually want to have a base for the sake of living in the world. Living and furthering my exploration of the world below of course.I've played games since I was a kid so a lot of the magic of video games is a bit lost on me now but Subnautica caught me off guard and brought that magic back. It's easily in my top 10 games I've ever played maybe even top 5. If you're debating on playing this game please give it a shot!",Subnautica,1,

5654,"2018-03-19",0,0,177,0,1,"""This ecological biome matches 7 of the 9 preconditions for stimulating terror in humans."" This game is terrific and at times terrifying it can also be heartwrenching. It is more than survival but it is survival at it's most basic. I won't give spoilers aside from saying it's a horrific shame to be here in this amazingly beautiful world alone. I have played a couple of other ""survival"" games but this one actually gives you the total sense of isolation while communicating with you. You have no one to talk to but your PDA talks to you and it's not just mind numbing information. You can't talk to your PDA however were I really to be in this situation I would be talking back to my PDA the same way I talk to my screen when I play. Sometimes I laugh at the comments sometimes I'm just like ""No sharding Sherlock...."" but it really does communicate with you not just talk at you and by that I mean that the information is meaningful and not just data. I have found a place where the biome matches 9 out of the 9 conditions by the way and one of those conditions is a sense of hopelessness. I did however manage to limp my way back.The beauty of the game world is captivating and alive. You don't long for life and the place feels far far from dead. You do long for others however and being with others is always just out of grasp. Subnautica motivates you to do everything. It drives you to explore it drives you to build it drives you to work toward a sense of normalcy when there is no normal anymore. Subnautica pushes you to face your fears and to actually dive deeper in every aspect of the meaning. In the begining you are totally helpless and while that situation improves some you are NEVER the big fish. For all the tech at your disposal you have the means to survive but never the means to dominate. You are actually in over your head. Being in over your head however doesn't take away all hope ever and pushes you to explore and challenge yourself and go further and deeper.The sense of what could be never goes away the sense that you need to leave remains the sense that you will miss this place when you do grows and grows but you know one thing you can't stay and even knowing that you will miss this place and all the effort you put into it you know you can't really come back for a vacation either and if you did it wouldn't be the same. Part of the beauty is the isolation and the isolation while leading to despair at times is part of what makes it feel so amazing. Were you to live in this world with a group of people it would be ruined. Measures would be taken to ensure that humanity becomes the big fish and the big fish are part of what makes this world what it is. I wouldn't mind surviving with a partner but the one thing that is most out of place in this world is you and were anything to change it it would be ruined. That is part of why you can't stay I feel not just due to the isolation but because you are actually lucky to be alive and see what this world has to offer.",Subnautica,1,

5663,"2018-06-14",0,0,32,0,1,I haven't written any reviews before and my english isn't really that good so bare with me. But for this game I just had to write a review.When I saw this game I thought it would be just a regular survival game but underwater. I thought that that was an interesting concept so I tried it for a bit. At first it really was just a survival game it looked amazing. The more I played and the more I explored I started to notice that there was more in this game then you would think. This game wasn't just an ordinary survival game you had a goal you had to escape this planet. Not only that this whole game had an amazing story line which would unfold by reading little PDA's which you would find by exploring . This game is so beautiful and I must say it was terrifying. There were moments were I really jumped there were moments were I felt like a hero because I would've done something that was really amazing. Another fun part of this game is that you can't really kill fish with weapons I think this makes sure that players don't just gather weapons and start killing everything this makes sure you have to play smart to make sure you don't die. I just finished the game this game is easily one of the best games i've ever played and I recommend this game to anyone who likes survival games and likes a little mystery that slowly unfolds.Now for the pros and cons Pros Beautiful graphics Music is amazing The sounds that you hear underwater are really well made and might be terrifying The story is amazing The way that you learn new items and new means of travel are really well thought of You really get the feeling that you are unraveling a mysteryCons There are little bugs that I found at the end but werent anything massive You get thrown in the game without explanation (Could be a positive thing depends on the player),Subnautica,1,

5666,"2018-01-24",1,1,44,0,1,This game was an amzing survival and stragety genre i loved how the ocean gave you moments of pure beauty and even suspense out of the fear of the creatures in the depths the story was amazing even if the player was a silent protangonist the story was still being driven the music as well was perfected and it was something i liked listening to on my playthrough of it as it never got boring the ending which im not going to spoil was also very well produced and had that amazing epic feel to it where you get goosebumps not out of fear but out of awe instead but they topped it off nicely with a little funny one liner from the robotic PDA voice which i admit was quite funny The gameplay was also really good where i barely spotted any bugs and the graphics even on low were still something that would be covered by the baeuty of the ocean planet but when on high quality as i mostly spent my time with that setting set onto the settings it was just amazing i do definetly recomend this game as for its price it seems almost generous to have it sold at that price but it is still an amazing deal i recommend this game to anyone into survival genres and even thrilling genres too as sometimes it can get quite scary too.,Subnautica,1,
5667,"2018-06-30",0,0,134,0,1,Heroes are a strange thing. In recent years the super heroes themselves are well known for killing and fighting. But the best kind of hero is the one who saves lives not those that end them. In Subnautica you are not simply a survivor you are a super hero of the rarest breed.*THIS WILL BE A SPOILER FREE REVIEW ANY DETAILS MENTIONED WILL NOT REVEAL ANY KEY STORYLINE FEATURES*To begin with this game is anything but a grind and that is unusual for survival games. If you have ever played games like Ark Survival Evolved then you will instantly see the contrast here. Subnautica is more about exploration and survival rather than driving you to do endless resource runs and build vast warehouses for your next base or whatever. In many ways the game is vastly more enjoyable due to this fact. Yes you have to look for materials but they are readily available and you only need small quantities for most craftable and buildable items. What's more exploration is not hampered like in games such as Ark as most creatures in Subnautica do not have the ability to ambush you and leave you wondering what hit you when you respawn. But what it does do is broadcast the presense of the creatures who are capable of doing some serious injury to you with audio clue that you hear long before you get within aggro range of them. And this moves me on to the next point.Subnautica is almost a survival horror game in how it presents itself. Not in the gory way but due to the tension it generates with the aforementioned predators. In some of the best horror movies you never saw the monster but you hear them somewhere in the dark this is how Subnautica can be truely nerve wracking at times too. The largest predators the ones that really need to be avoided at all costs tend to hang around specific areas of the oceans you never really feel safe in those areas even when you know roughly where they are. I took to marking their territory with bouys so that I would know that when I heard them they were in a specific direction usually. Since you can hear them from up to 300m away you generally need some indication that what you are hearing is not actually close enouh to be a threat else you end up constantly watching your back for no reason. You do eventually get provided with various vehicles and tools that give you a greater measure of protection. The Seaglide is a standard hand held engine which gives you some significant speed when swimming this in itself allows you to out run most predators with ease. The Seamoth is your first true vehicle a simple one man sub which gives you that added protection since anything that wants to eat you has to chew through the hull first. Moving up again you have the PRAWN mech suit which is far tougher than the Moth but not as fast. It's best used for mining the larger mineral deposits but is also the only way you can actually do damage to the local wildlife. It's not much but most predators tend to turn tail and run if you hit them twice. Finally you have the Cyclops sub this is a vehicle intended for a 3 man crew and due to it's size it is ignored by most predators. It becomes more like a mobile base of operations but its sluggish speed means you can't really explore with it unless you kind of know there is nothing dangerous where you are going. You can also dock the Seamoth or PRAWN into the sub so I would often dock the sub somewhere near to an unexplored region and then undock the PRAWN to scout the area first. But as i said it does get extremely tense when entering an unknown area especially the depths of the ocean where visibility to very poor at times and the only light is from bioluminesant flora and fauna. Or lava. Or rivers of green sulferous goo.Now this is not to say that the game is without bugs. The most common seem to be relating to the local wildlife being able to pass through solid geometry at times and this can really be frustrating if you suddenly have a very large predator appear from within a solid rockface and invite you to dinner. Or when you find the local goldfish 'swimming' through the corridors of your underwater base as if the air was as valid a substance to swim through as the water outside the bulkheads. Fortunaely these instances are not common but they do get annoying from time to time.All in all Subnautica will take you a good 50+ hours to really finish if you take the scenic route. The developers were kind enough to signpost your way through the objectives but as I eventually discovered it helped me a great to not just follow the breadcrumbs or else a lot of backtracking would have been needed. There is a measure of replay value here but the world is not randomly generated so once you've played through it once you'll lose the awe wonder and terror that the game produces in abundance during your first play through.Wholeheartedly 1 here's hoping more survival games take notice of what this title did so well.,Subnautica,1,

5669,"2015-09-01",0,0,14,1,1,Very enjoyable game lovely visuals and mood great feeling of being a diver in an alien reef.I have two big beefs with it at the moment but I expect both to be solved with time because I have been VERY impressed with the frequent and substantial updates the developer is making to the game they are clearly commited and this is early in development still.The first issue is that there isn't much in the way of end game/late content. After playing it for 11 hours (that includes starting over a couple of times) there's just not much left to see or do. As I said though from their current track record I have every confidence that the developer will add more stuff until it has substantial gameplay. I'm only mentioning it so you know what you're going in to if you're buying it now and hoping to play a lot right away.Issue number 2 is... well myself and several others on the forum have serious issues with motion sickness in this game particularly when piloting the small SeaMoth vehicle. I can only play for small periods (10 mins or so) if using that vehicle before having to stop. I sincerely hope the controls will be tweaked to reduce the nausea.Final verdict Want to support a game that's almost assuredly going places and looks awesome? Put some bucks inthere now It's worth it. Want a substantial game to play and not just a bit of colourful exploring and crafting for a few hours? Wait with your purchase.,Subnautica,1,

5681,"2019-02-05",42,349,40,0,1,"Oh man it's been at least a decade since Ace Combat 6 and we finally have 7 released. I've played the numbered Ace Combat games from 2 6 and to any series veteran wondering if its worthwhile I'll tell you this.If the previous Ace Combat games were that kid back in the 7th grade who was down to play Goldeneye or Mario Kart with you all day everyday.Ace Combat 7 is that same kid a decade and a half later after they age up and manage to become a gazebo owner and still is down to play those games with you.Even though 7 is all triple A and hella purdy grafixs planes now (and arguably flawed compared to the older games in it's story/amount of content) the gameplay feels just like it should with new things to keep it fresh like the new weather mechanics and there are still some throwbacks to previous games and traditional moments that make you go...YEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSS YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSS MY STIFF THOTTLE STICK IS COVERED IN VANILLA COLOURED MOTOR OIL RIGHT NOW AND I CAN'T EJECT OUT OF MY MESSY CANOPY or you know a similar sensation but less extreme of course.To those new to Ace Combat games I would definitely recommend picking this one up on a sale.If you have that feeling of ""wow I need a break from all these FPSs open worlds and sidescrollers and need a cool game out of the ordinary""This is that game right here.

5682,"2019-02-01",6,358,27,0,1,I'll start by making it abundantly clear that I am a huge fan of the ace combat series. I have played to 100% completion just about every one of them baring Assault Horizons which I don't view as an Ace Combat game. As such I feel it's important that I do my due diligence and write a review for those who come after me to determine if they wish to purchase this game.I'll start by clarifying that at the time of writing this there is a large amount of review bombing occuring so I will directly be refuting the points being made by the negative reviewers at the moment.1st There are claims this is a low grade console port.It has some alarmingly bad PC setup problems You can't change settings outside of basic flight control settings. IE inverting your controls and slightly altering flight style.2nd This game is meant to be played with a controller just like Darksouls from From Software.This is an arcade plane game. It has always been designed this way. If you expect 100% realism with complete HOTAS support from an Ace Combat game you've missed the point of Ace Combat. 3rd Bandai Namco is remaining silentThis is 0 they posted on the forums how to fix the problem with HOTAS until they can bug fix.https //steamcommunity.com/games/502500/announcements/detail/1729848148045983457This is the link. Stop screaming that they didn't do anything within 24 hours of release. Gods above.That out of the way my state in the game.Played through the campaign the first time beat it. Working on getting the rest of the planes and their upgradesI have not yet played Multiplayer.Yay Incredibly beautiful graphics. Amazingly optimized I experienced zero frame loss at the most intense moments of gameplay. I had 40 planes on screen at a point lasers flying to and from missiles everywhere. Flares being dumped left and right. No frame loss.Incredibly fun campaign encourages replayability with custom skins and unlocks which become available upon completion of certain requirements. Like previous games it adds aces which you can kill to unlock their special skins. To get them to appear you must perform to your highest in every mission ((Do certain things that enable them to spawn))Really fun high octane fast paced A classic Ace Combat gameReally good controller supportDecent difficulty rampX 02 Wyvern's backNay Feels hand holdy when it comes to landing/refueling... Makes me feel like I'm a baby and takes some of the fun out of it by essentially completing these tasks for me...It's an Arcade game so planes routinely do unrealistic things like high G maneuvers without their pilots passing out.((I was beyond confused the first time I seen an Su 30SM perform an Immelmann turn only to fly straight back down yo yo style before it ramped up to max speed within 2 seconds and juke off screen)) &lt This.Lack of PC settings that we all adore and love.Shortish campaign. 20 missionsIn closing I love this series I like this game. It's a great entry. I intend to keep playing as soon as my work schedule allows me to and my partner stops giving me dirty looks when I drool over the models of some of the planes. If you like Ace Combat Fires of Liberation and more specifically The Belkan War you'll love this game. Just keep in mind this is a console game being brought to PC it was always a console series and expecting their first game outside of Assault Horizons to be perfect is silly. I hope you will find this review helpful and enlightening!,ACE COMBAT™ 7: SKIES UNKNOWN,1,
5683,"2019-02-03",5,149,3,0,1,Product received for free. Disclaimer My copy of the game was provided by Bandai Namco Entertainment as thanks for my work at Acepedia the Ace Combat wiki. I also purchased the special collector's Strangereal Edition for PC but that code is going to someone else.My playtime here does not include the hours and hours I've spent playing this game on PS4. Ace Combat 7 Skies Unknown is the return to form that Ace Combat has so desperately needed for over a decade. We haven't had a proper Ace Combat game in so long and while I loved Ace Combat Infinity to death it was a free to play game and not a complete experience.Ace Combat 7 is a complete experience. It features an enthralling detailed story that goes in directions you don't expect. It can be a little convoluted at times but this is part of the charm of Ace Combat storytelling figuring out the truth in the mess of conflict and strife. I daresay that this game is the most accurate of Ace Combat portrayals of the chaos of war. It all goes to hell as it should.The performance of the game on PC is astounding. The Steam version is truly the ultimate version of Ace Combat 7 with support up to 4K resolutions 8K supersampling uncapped framerates and any XInput gamepad you can plug into your computer... Yes the flight stick support is a little disappointing but that's not how Ace Combat was meant to be played anyway. The real disappointment here is the lack of in game TAA support draw distance options and removal of chromatic aberration and vignetting. Thankfully most of these can be fixed very quickly cleanly and easily. See the PC Gaming Wiki for details you'll definitely notice improvements.The presentation... my god this is the most gorgeous Ace Combat game ever created. The graphics. The music. The sound effects. The aircraft models. The cockpit models. Seeing my sweet baby the X 02 and Stonehenge in full HD. And it's not 110% realistic there's some expert shading and design work at play that makes it look uniquely Ace Combat while remaining close enough to reality that you can enjoy it fully.The real big disappointment for me is the multiplayer component. This isn't something that affects my personal opinion of the game itself as I care far more for the single player experience. But many fans myself included were hoping for an online cooperative experience like Ace Combat Infinity since that game showed just how well Ace Combat works with PvE multiplayer. Instead the multiplayer here is very barebones with just TDM and FFA. A shame. Not enough to make me dislike this game but still a shame.For all of those who have been looking for a chance to dip into the Ace Combat franchise this is your gateway. Ace Combat 7 retains the incredible unparalleled gameplay everyone has come to expect from Ace Combat and everything else (besides the lackluster multiplayer) has raised the bars to match. It's here. It's beautiful. It's time.,ACE COMBAT™ 7: SKIES UNKNOWN,1,
5684,"2019-01-31",14,640,21,0,1,Edit I've now completed the campaign and I wholeheartedly stand behind my appreciation of the game after the first three missions (which is described in the following review). Other users have also pointed out that the Logitech Extreme 3D Pro is not supported (although I've seen reports of people using unsupported sticks with a controller emulator).As you can see from my playtime I've only completed three missions so far so don't take this review as something written by someone who completed the game because that's not currently true. With that out of the way I'd like to leave a positive rating to help people who do not have a HOTAS at their disposal and would like to know if the game runs well (and is as good as previous Ace Combat titles).Playing with an Xbox 360 joystick on a 4770k 16gb RAM GTX 1070 machine running at 1080p I'm getting a near locked 120fps maxed. So the PC version is far from badly optimized. The planes control very well with the 360 pad and if I can find my Extreme 3D Pro I'll report back on that as well.I read that 4K support is in actually though other people report that's not the case so if that's important to you there's a chance it might not work.Otherwise the game is excellent so far with clear mission objectives beautiful graphics and outstanding gameplay that more than makes up for the travesty that was Assault Horizon.,ACE COMBAT™ 7: SKIES UNKNOWN,1,

5686,"2019-02-01",9,141,17,0,1,I have absolutely no idea what s going on and I m loving every second of itAce Combat 7 Skies Unknown is the most recent and long awaited instalment in the Ace Combat franchise. This is my first Ace Combat game so my understanding of the story is limited to you re some guy being ordered by some other guy to help defend one country that sounds an awful lot like the country you re attacking. The story really is as confusing as it is ridiculous but maybe that s just because this is my first game in the franchise.Positives It s just great fun. I love arcade flight games and one of the main reasons is because it s just non stop ridiculous action and AC7 is no different. Tearing through the skies at insane speeds and then doing what s effectively a handbrake turn to get the drop on your enemy is just so satisfying especially when you blow them up and get to fly through the explosion.The controls are tight and the planes feel nice and responsive. This is obviously super important for any flight game but particularly important here in this fast paced action a thon. So far I ve unlocked and flown about seven different planes and each one does feel unique. For example the A 10 feels a lot heavier than the Gripen I d highly recommend not using the A 10 in a dogfight!There s a great variety of different planes and weapons to choose from. Initially you start with one (three if you have the launch edition though one of those doesn t have combat capabilities) and more are unlocked by spending MRP in the Aircraft tree. MRP is earned by completing campaign missions and multiplayer matches if you re really trying to unlock something you do earn more MRP in multiplayer so it might be worth grinding a little bit.The multiplayer is surprisingly fun. Typically I don t play multiplayer at all but I decided to try it out last night and it was really good fun. You have a battle royal mode which is an eight person free for all and a team deathmatch where players are put into teams and face off against each other. I think the battle royal mode is a bit more enjoyable and more suited to this kind of game but they were both good fun. I was a little concerned about how few people were playing the multiplayer but I m assuming that most people were just too busy playing through the campaign.There s enemy AI seems very competent. I ve been playing on normal and while I haven t been having too much trouble dodging missiles (yet) some of the enemies are pretty agile and it takes some chasing to shoot them down. There s been a good balance in the missions so far between ground enemies fighters drones and bombers. I haven t felt bored by what I m fighting. Despite the story being well weird and confusing the voice acting is actually really good. I was expecting the voices to be super cheesy but actually it s quite nice hearing the chatter during the missions brings some more life to the game. Also the rest of the sound effects and music are good too. As far as I can tell so far no map is re used. If this is the case then that means twenty different maps which is great. All of the maps I ve seen so far in the campaign and multiplayer have been well designed and nice to look at. There s one map I played in multiplayer that had these towering rock formations that were great fun to dodge in and out of. There s also a free flight mode so you can always go back and just be a tourist in your multi million dollar jet.There are two replays at the end of each mission which are really cool. The first is a regular replay you can watch how you played the mission while changing camera angles speeding it up or slowing it down and you can toggle the display if you want to grab some nice screenshots. I would have liked more fast forward/rewind options and scrubbing would have been good but it s a fun little feature nonetheless. The second replay comes while you re watching your points get tallied up after the mission it s basically neon arrows flying around a black box which may not sound super interesting but the arrows actually do a great job showing off the different manoeuvres you pulled off. These replays aren t something I m going to watch at the end of each mission but I m really glad they re in the game.Speaking of replays replaying the missions with different planes/to get higher scores is a lot of fun and I ve actually already gone back to do that despite only being a few missions in. I haven t achieved any S ranks yet but I m trying to get all A s (hope my parents are proud!)It runs really well. I have a pretty modest laptop and I m having absolutely no trouble running it on medium at 1080p.Negatives The game has launched with broken HOTAS support which has led to the game being review bombed. Personally I prefer playing these kinds of arcade flying games with a controller rather than my HOTAS but I felt it was important to include this anyway. I m hoping we ll see a fix soon so the reviews can start to reflect how much fun the game is.This probably isn t a big deal to many other people but I m really disappointed that there s no take off and landings in the free flight mode. One of my favourite parts of HAWX 2 was doing the full take off and landing in free flight mode some of the missions even let you taxi. Free flight mode is much less interesting without this in my opinion. Here s hoping Project Wingman will include it.I would have liked to see another singleplayer mode in here something like a wave based mode where you fight increasingly more numerous and difficult enemies. It s not a huge deal that there s nothing like that but it would add some more replay value to the game. Verdict Ace Combat 7 Skies Unknown is an absolute blast the story is utterly ridiculous but the action more than makes up for it. There are a couple of things that let it down a little bit but if you re a fan of arcade flight games then this is an absolute must have.If you found this review helpful please check out my other reviews over at Kemo's Corner.,ACE COMBAT™ 7: SKIES UNKNOWN,1,

You have two choices join your friends escape the horrors or be left for dead.Left 4 Dead 2 is the classic Zombie Survival Shooter made by the greatest minds of Valve. This is one of my favorite coop games out in the market today. GAMEPLAY The game is fun and challenging. The different chapters give out a new style of gameplay. The game offers a wide array of weapons. The zombie types is where the game shines. Jockey Spitter Smoker Charger Boomer Hunter Witch and Tank zombies will hinder your success. These zombies will join the normal zombie horde to lower your survival rate. Trust me a jockey charger and smoker simultaneous attack can leave the group in disarray and will be easy pickings for the normal zombies. Everytime you finish a segment of the chapter you and your friends get a feeling of relief that the worst is over but you know you guys are wrong about that conclusion. STORY and CHARACTERS Left 4 Dead 2 is about the story of four new survivors Coach Ellis Nick and Rochelle. Each has their own backstory and their own traits which you can see through their different dialogue throughout the game.All in all Left 4 Dead 2 is a 9/10. Me and my friends still play it today because of it being that fun and exciting.,Left 4 Dead 2,1,

I have to be honest I'm not a MPG fan per se however what I enjoyed about L4D2 and it's original is that you work together. You can be that hero and save all the others. You can kill the Tank whilst your team mates are all injured. You can sacrifice yourself for the good of the team. There are so many standout moments that I have had playing this. I'm not the best gamer in the world but with L4D2 it really doesn't matter it's about teamwork and pulling together making sure you have someone's back flinging the pipe bomb at just the right moment sniping that smoker right before he strangles a team mate.Best zombie game in my opinion and when I want to play something fun I'll always load this game up just stay away from that witch!,Left 4 Dead 2,1,

Suddenly a horde of the undead tear through the house screaming Randy Savage quotes and the team brings the fight into the garden retaliating by announcing each weapon reload in voices that are not theirs.As the battle seems won the mysterious voice announces that he has arrived in his boat and is waiting on the other side of the fence.

5765,"2016-02-10",17,203,529,0,1,Yes this game is good. It's worth buying. Yes even after almost 7 years after the release people still play it even despite the fact it didn't really receive any new content. Why? Well let me explain.Is it good because of graphics? Totally not. Even for early 2010's graphics weren't anything that impressive. It's still almost the same Source engine which powered Half Life 2 and episodes. Yes it was constantly updated but it didn't really progress. I mean we still have the same concept from early 90's a game server hosts a map and up to 16 or 32 (or even 64 in some modifications) players can join and move around the map. You can reach certain points of the map and it will load another map. And that's all about it. But it's not open world in any sense. It's something that reminds me of Doom and Quake games. In fact Source was partially based on Quake engine after all.But don't think graphics are bad. No they are pretty enjoyable. I just don't recall technological advancement being a major selling point for this game. The game can impress you sometimes. Some textures look really dated. But overall it's just there. The game graphics won't make you scream in excitement nor it will disappoint you even in 2016. A lot of stuff is destructible. I saw hours spent on zombie animations infected puke beat eachother walk around die spectacularly if killed. It's nice to see actual damage done to their zombies' bodies some severe dismemberment and burning. But some may say graphics are kinda old. (Please don't think I'm one of these guys who only cares about polygons and realism I'm just getting started.)So maybe the story is the main element here? Nope you can complete the entire game without even learning anything about the characters or what's actually going on. You and 3 other people are given a selection of weaponry medical supplies some other stuff. You have a very simple goal get to your destination or do something. Just get out of there alive.So why anything from 10 to 20 thousand people are playing this game right now? Why so many people played it for two or three thousand hours? Because of gameplay.Words cannot describe how many different situations there are. There are only 10 or so types of enemies 3 basic types of main weapons a few different secondary weapons grenades and other items. And that's it. I know it may sound a lot at first but very quickly you acquire a taste for a favorite combination of weapons and items.Left 4 Dead series somehow manage to make people spend thousands of hours of their time playing the same set of maps. And it's a corridor shooter which means there is only one way to achieve your destination. How it's done then? Well every time different items get generated in different places you get zombies from different spawn points. You can play the same maps over and over again and again. And people actually do.Speaking of people it's a multiplayer. Yes there is single player mode where you can complete campaign with bots. But the most fun is playing with people. I find PvE aspect extremely interesting. Keep in mind your enjoyment really depends on people you play with. This game is about cooperation you will never be able to complete it alone. So you have to find a server with good players maybe you should play with friends maybe you should make friends with people who play properly. Playing with bunch of griefers will suck. Playing with someone who actually wants to play is the best thing since sliced bread. Holy crap you have to help eachother. Someone shares a medkit with you. His medkit. A medkit is being spent to restore your health you wasted because you made bunch of mistakes. But someone helps you for some reason. And you help them back sharing resources with them. Oh and keep in mind there is no reward system for helping others.There is PvP where you play as a bunch of zombies against a team of survivors controlled by other players. But I don't think it's as good as regular campaign. If someone thinks you are bad for the team they just kick you out. Call me a weirdo but I play it because of sense of fellowship or at least some basic positive human interaction. I don't really like the idea that someone may feel bad because I outsmarted them.I think I finally cracked Valve's logic. The main thing about a videogame is gameplay. This is exactly why we have these debates %gamename% isn't a real videogame!!11 and other stuff. It's gameplay first. Yes you need amazing visuals to make a masterpiece but it isn't the main thing you should focus on. I heard about Crysis as a game with great graphics many years ago finally I decided to give it a try. I was utterly bored after a couple of hours its gameplay was dull. Yes you need story and great sound effects. But they still are only an excuse for gameplay.Left 4 Dead 2 doesn't fail to illustrate this concept. You can play it right away you don't have to read wiki for 2 hours to craft a pickaxe or to build a basic rocket to orbit Kerbin. It takes minutes to learn basic concepts. Easy to learn difficult to master yes we have it. But after a couple of hours I began to care about the story. You play as one of 4 characters who are they? Turns out they are almost real people with some depth to them. Not too much just enough to understand how they feel about each other. The whole story of zombie virus is told through surroundings. You see countless writings on the walls a lot of documents are scattered around. The story told not using some boring and forced cutscenes but using details. You may skip story elements if you don't care about it. Or you may spend hours reading L4D wiki like I did.Valve remembers that this is a game. If you look through L4D concept art you will see that survivors were supposed to look a lot more different. They wore a lot more utilitarian gear. In the final game they are wearing casual clothing which helps to establish who they were before the outbreak. I mean look at Rochelle's ear rings. I know what zombies would tear away first. It's unrealistic and is it bad? Nope it's fine it's a videogame not a reflection of reality.There is a lot of stuff in Left 4 Dead series which have never been done before. Developers added commentaries in game how they ended up creating everything it's really interesting to check out. And I think I finally understand Valve's logic they create games with some new elements. They create a game it succeeds. Then they make a sequel which feels much better they implement everything they need to make a great videogame experience. This is exactly what happened to Portal and Portal 2 Left 4 Dead and Left 4 Dead 2. This is exactly why Half Life 3 may never happen what exactly new can you say about first person shooter genre? It was told so many times it's really hard to come up with something new. And this is exactly why they keep working on Left 4 Dead 3. At least it seems they are working on it. After all Left 4 Dead 2 appears to be incomplete to me. I feel like you can add more stuff in this concept.But right now it's totally worth spending money on Left 4 Dead 2. It's a very addictive game and most importantly people are still playing it. If you get bored there are tons of content in Steam Workshop you can b a s t a r d ize the game with (if in you are in that kind of stuff).,Left 4 Dead 2,1,

5912,"2015-08-16",724,2396,1094,1,1,"This is a review of the offline game. This game has been one of the best games I have ever played. I have been playing games for over 25 years and haven't experienced a game this epic. I'd like to share one of my quests. I had just finished my first base on a peninsula. It had a bed and some storage containers and was starting to feel pretty safe. I hadn't seen many dangerous Dino other that dilos (the ones that killed the fat guy in Jurassic park). I had stockpiled some goods and decided I would go try to tame something worth taming. I found a raptor in a valley surrounded by rocks and decided he was gonna be my buddy. The taming process was pretty intense so it really made me want to keep my Raptor safe. I saddled him up and decided to give him a go. He was amazing we ran around killing everything. After about 30 mins of running and killing things I decided to go home and give my new buddy a rest. We ran through the night and in the morning i realized how extra lost i was and got worried. I decided that the best way to find my way home was to climb a mountain and look around. After 5 mins or so of looking and referencing the map I finally figured out where we were. Just as I was about to put my map away I was ambushed by several scorpions and unfortunately they killed me. After I respawned back at my base I was in panic mode and jumped on my only other ride able Dino which was a Parasaur and hauled back to where my raptor was. We never made it. About halfway there we were attacked by a pack of raptors and both were killed. My next re spawn was kinda bleak from the start. I re spawn in a random location that I thought would be near my Dino. After what seemed like hours of carefully navigating my map back to where i though my Dino was I started to freeze and starve. I would move thirty to fifty feet and whistle then repeat. The sun went down and my hopes for recovering my dino with it. Just as I had given up hope I was surrounded by scorpions and I thought ""oh well"". A second later my Raptor jumped down from the rocky ledges above and killed one of the scorpions. I frantically jumped on his back and ran from the other scorpions. My health was still falling due to the cold and me starving. Once we got to relative safety I hopped off his back and checked his inventory. Somehow he had collected a full suit of armor and plenty of berries whilst we were hunting earlier. We eventually dodged meat eaters and found our way home once the sun rose. I have never felt that since of disparity and relief from a video game before. It sounds funny but it really felt like the raptor saved my life. I've never got that into a game before. That one experience was worth more than what I paid for the game.",ARK: Survival Evolved,1,

5917,"2016-09-08",0,0,714,1,0,Ark Evolved has provided me with hundreds of hours of entertainment. It was an example of Early Access done right. But with diverting more and more resources to other projects without actually finishing the core game and now the unprecedented release of paid DLC before the game is even finished I can no longer support or recommend this game.,ARK: Survival Evolved,1,
5918,"2015-12-21",0,0,64,1,1,Really good game! Needs a lot more updates not just adding dinos! I hate the bugs though. They are updating the game a lot and making it more playable. Remember the first day it came out? It was unplayable with bugs lags etc. I mean the dinos were teleporting everywhere and stuff haha. Yeah this game is really good I have it on all of my steam accounts. The game is being updated a lot but realistically they are just adding items and dinos to the game but not REALLY focussing on bugs to be fair. I run a dedicated server on the game I would like more things added to the servers like admin commands you cant even fly because you go super slow its pointless. The game does have a high potential.,ARK: Survival Evolved,1,
5919,"2015-10-27",0,0,1426,1,1,Greetings one and all. I want to express my feelings on this game. My experience. But first I will roll with the pro's and the cons.Pros 1.Breathtaking game with beautiful (as well as immersive) scenery 2.It's not just PvP it is PvPE . In other words you have to watch your back for both players and the environment. 3.It does have a PvE setting for those who desire less stressful gameplay 4.Easy to learn game for anyone starting! Hours of fun! 5. And for those that got ripped from Stomping Land this game is CONSTANTLY updating with new features! Even getting it now while it's still in early access isn't a bad thing! This game isn't so broken it isn't playable AND enjoyable! 6. Tamable Species of all sorts! ((Not just dinos anymore folks!)) Anywhere from prehistoric mammals and dinos to unique sealife! 7. This game prides itself to work together with others. Sure you can go play solo in a server if you wanted. But official servers you are limited with how much knowledge you can gain. So this also limits your crafting? Is this a bad thing? No. It strives people to work together or for those solo players out there. A challenge in the fact that you can overlook this hinderance by finding the blueprints within unique crates that appear randomly over the island!8. Mod friendly! That's right folks! The Dev team has offered the option for player's themselves to make mods to even further the content of this game! You will find thousands of community made mods to enhance your gameplay!Now the Cons1. The game is still in early access. Which means you will run into random glitches that can cause some hinderance in gameplay. ((Fun part is the Dev team knows about these glitches and if you find one they may have skipped? You can actually message the dev team via forums and they WILL answer!))2. Hackers. yes this is a problem in most games. The official servers cane be crawling with them. ((Fun part! Their are several servers and even unofficial servers ran by other players! Also contacting the dev team via forums you will find a thread dedicated in finding such hackers or hacks in the game so they can prevent them with their anti cheat system!))3. Playing alone can be difficult to most and even if you are a social butterfly some people may find it hard to welcome you with open arms. Players are indeed ruthless and the environment even more so. ((if you were me however you will consider this a challange! &gt D))4. Official Servers. They are good and bad depending on how you look at it. Sometimes it's just the server itself always constantly full or maybe the tame rate for some of these creatures are too much for those who want to devote their time to this game. Fear not! That is why they also offer Unnoffical servers! 5. Mod Friendly. This is both a good and bad thing. Mods are fun! They enhance gameplay whether you are looking for more immersion or straight up silliness. However playermade mods can be gamebreaking. Causing errors to the server and/or issues with the actual gameplay once installed. So be careful and read carefully which mods you are adding in!Overall I utterly enjoy this game! I've always been a big dinosaur nut ((or prehistoric nut in this case!)) ever since I was little and for the Dev team of this game to finally come out with something enjoyable and immersive like this? Makes my inner child scream with joy! Take it from me ((a victim of the stomping land fiasco)) This game is worth ir's weight in gold! ((or in this case cash! XD)) Until then friends this is Vaughne signing off! I'll see you in the game!,ARK: Survival Evolved,1,
5920,"2017-08-30",0,0,1062,0,0,Though the basic idea is a good one the game itself suffers from unprofessionel developers. Actually I cannot recall a single release date or promise that wildcard did actually could hold. They NEVER release on the promised date and the ALWAYS miss at least half the promised stuff. Best example is the last 'Release Update'.The promised Fully working game with virtually no bugs left two new creatures Otter and Phoenix new gear ability to download ice wyvernsThey delivered most of the old bugs still remain collision has never worked with this game that has not changed clipping and falling through the landscape still are common also a lot of sync issues. I seriously doubt the devs ability to fix this ever... of the 2 creatures a single one is available for only PC (not Xbox/Palystation) no new gear no ability to download the ice wyvernsAnd this is not a special thing it's like that for the last 2 years on every single release date. That makes up my impression of dealing with a group of hobby developers that are really far away from any competence. Interestingly they have a great mod community that does a lot of those things that the devs are not capable of.All in all Good idea done badly. The release price is totally out of this world but wildcards are really quite greedy They even released a DLC for the game in it'S unfinished state. If you see this here on a sale for under 20 bucks go for it... and bring a lot of patience as the inofficial ark slogan is it's not a bug it'S a feature ),ARK: Survival Evolved,1,

5925,"2017-09-01",0,0,1250,0,0,Was a great game for a while in the early months. The devs started adding too much content in my opinion they should have just kept it a primitive dinosaur game but they had to add all this tek and high tier t which I felt ruined the game. All my friends and I had so much fun when it was just simple and primitive with dinosaur pvp and not trexes shooting lazers out of their ing saddles and flying birds holding tens of thousands of pounds of stuff on their back. What has really motivated me to write this negative review for Ark is this outragous price this game should be no more than 25 dollars. The state of the official servers are a joke. Unless you're playing with a tribe of 35 people and can get past the spawn huts built by the tribes who have been on the server since the game came out(yes the official servers have never been wiped) it's almost impossible to get started. with the addition on Tek to the game it has made it even harder for the new player to start. If they want to jack the price up to 60 dollars they better put more work into the official servers and bugs litering the game.,ARK: Survival Evolved,1,
5926,"2017-05-05",92,2412,531,1,0,"I have over 200 hours into the game compared to a lot of ARK players i'm still a noob so if you aren't ready to turn this into a full time job don't even bother thinking about getting this game. I'll explain why this game is a full time job later on but basically it punishes any player that can't or won't play it 24/7. First I'll talk about the PvE. I started playing PvE on a private server with friends and had tons of fun discovering everything there is to enjoy. We started on The Center the biggest and in my opinion the coolest of the three maps. The beginning is the hardest part for new players. Every dino you meet can easily kill a noob even the spitter dinos. It can be annoying running around naked and getting killed by raptors but stick with it and find your friends and build a safe place. Once you get the base built the game gets so much more fun. Every new dino you find is cool and it so fun the first time you get all your friends together and explore a cave. The most dangerous foes we encountered in PvE were the alpha predators. Our base got killed multiple times by alpha raptors but it was fun because it showed us that even though we had a big base with spike walls and gaurd towers there was still a threat out there that had to be beaten. Ofcourse once you build a metal base nothing can break it anymore and once you tame flying mounts you don't have to worry about dangerous expeditions so late game it got boring. We basically got to the point that nothing PvE had to throw at us outside of boss battles was a challenge and even fighting bosses had no point because what would we use the tek gear to kill? Harder versions of that boss? That's why we decided to turn to PvP to see if that was better late game.Pro tip don't PvP. This game is designed in such a way that the big tribes that are on top stay on top. New tribes and new players just get pooped on in every single way unless they join an alpha and become a resource harvesting slave. Let's walk through all the reason PvP is horrible.1.) Alpha tribes. They wipe the server once or twice a week and completly blow up any new players base and kill their dinos. They own the server they won't let anyone else even enjoy the game.2.) Unless you're alpha you don't get a base they might let you live in a thatch hut. Refer to reason 1.) 3.) Unless you're alpha you don't get to tame dinos they might let you tame dodos. Refer to reason 1.)4.) Unless you're alpha you don't get to upgrade any of your gear. Alphas block all loot drops (the good ones anyway) and fill all the caves with auto turrets to gun down anyone that tries to explore them.5.) Alpha tribes are literally impossible for smaller tribes to fight. They have huge metal bases with hundreds and hunderds of turrets and plants that will mow you down if you so much as look at it wrong. Rockets get shot down in mid air by these turrets and you won't get close enough to plant c4. You won't be able to bring dinos to tank the turret either refer to 1.)6.) Offline raiding. Just imagine working for 2 3 weeks building a pretty cool base completely surrounded by plant x and taming about 20 dinos then logging on to see a smoking crater where you base was. You don't get to save any of your gear you don't get to save any of your dinos you don't even get to fight back it's all just gone. This happens all the time and honestly offline raid protection should be baseline on all servers.7.) Battlemetrics. Alpha tribes and griefers use this website to figure out if you are online or not. If you log off for some reason sleep or work or whatever then they will know and they will raid you. They can even get text alerts that tell them the second you have logged off or on or if anything else unusual is going on on ""their"" server. Basically this site and sites like it are cancer. Also it doesn't tell them your in game name but you steam name that means even if you make another character they will know it's you. Also if you them off and try to go to another server they can just look up where you went using Battlemetrics and come find you. There is no hiding and no escape so you have to be nice and can't even PvP or else some loser with no life is going to come and find you on every single server you go to.8.) Breeding. Just another way to keep big tribes ontop. They have huge metal air conditioned rooms where they hatch 20 eggs at once each hatched dino gonna be 2x the level of anything a noob will have.9.) Tek gear. If the fact that they have 2 3x better gear by monopolizing all loot crates wasn't a big enough edge if the fact that they have 2 3x better dinos by building huge breeding rooms wasn't a big enough edge now they get tek gear too. If they come at you with anything tek and you have baseline gear and baseline dinos you are DEAD!10.) Ark is a full time job. You must log on every day to feed dinos or they will die. Breeding and imprinting are horrible and time consuming processes that I won't even touch. You must log on every day to make sure you haven't been raided and you must grind harder than everyone else to make sure you have the defenses and dinos to stop raiders. Don't try you won't. Look I'm tired of typing this review just know that if you enjoy PvP because you enjoy winning through skill then don't PvP. No Pvp skill required at this point their gear will have much higher armor and damage their dinos will have much higher hp and damage just accept your death and wipe multiple times because you will lose everything and you won't even be online to defend it not like you'd have a chance if you were.EDIT I never expected my review to actually be popular but now that it is I feel like I should address all the kids telling me I suck and that I'm still a noob who doesn't know what he's talking about.Firstly this is NOT a skill based game. This is a grind based offline raid based exploit based game. You can't come here and say I'm a noob especially when I've played the game solo as a small tribe for over 300 hours and I joined an alpha tribe for a week or two so I know how it goes on a larger scale. My opinion actually got even worse after joining the aplha tribe because I realized just how bad the game panders to these alpha tribes. Here are some more reasons I found from my time with the alphas why I will never recommend this game to anyone.1.) Alpha tribes can grind resources WAY easier than a new player. Now you would probably expect this. After all they have more players so it is only natural that they could send 5 out to grind while your tribe could only spare 1. No numbers isn't even what I'm talking about here I'm talking about EXPLOITS with a farming dino and a Quetzal. A noob with a hatchet can get 50 60 wood from a single tree. An alpha tribe can get 1500 wood from a single tree. A noob with a pickaxe can get 50 60 metal from a vein an alpha tribe can get 300 metal from a vein. A noob would take hours to farm 1 2k metal an alpha tribe can farm 20 30k metal in an hour. The list goes on and every single resource you can think of they can get insane amounts much faster and easier. Now noobs wont know how to do this and wouldn't be able to because Quetzals are hard to tame and hard to hide from alpha tribes. If they saw you flying around harvesting they would bring a Wyvern after you and start looking for your base.2.) Large scale PvP is extremely laggy. The servers are supposed to support up to 100 players but if you get more than 20 players in a server the lag becomes unbearable. Once again Alpha tribes exploit this by logging as many people as they can onto a server (kind of like DDOS) to block out defenders from connecting or to force the server to get so laggy that you can basically avoid taking damage from things.",ARK: Survival Evolved,1,

5928,"2017-08-30",0,0,170,0,0,Bought this game a while back when it was only $29.99. Pretty good buy back then because the game was rough but the content was streaming in before the console drops. Now I can only log in half of the time and when I do I spend the first 5 6 minutes every few feet rendering after having already waited a solid 8 minutes to login (Not even mentioning the massive amount of memory this game takes just to install). Don't get me wrong the game is okay aside from cheaters hats and random glitches. But Optimization should have been a priority over the bloated content within the game. Hell the Devs dropped an expansion during early access before it was even released and they didn't even give it to the people who bought the early access for free. Now they are selling it full price as well as the expansion which is an absurdity that cannot be made up. These early access games are the P2P Candy Crushes and Farmvilles of the real gaming world deliberately squeezing the funds out of fan boys just to make it seem more appealing to casuals while not supporting the real player base. You can make all the cool items/gear/loot to your hearts content but if the game doesn't function then that stuff has absolutely no value. I recommend this game to only masochists of the most devout nature.,ARK: Survival Evolved,1,

5930,"2016-09-08",1,7,26,1,0,I have owned ark for a year now and from my perspective it is not worth buying I am the type of gamer who likes to run games at max settings and I play at a high resolution of 3440x1440 but I also have a good computer to back it up 2x gtx 980ti's now I know sli isn't supported in every game but honestly it is supported in most and in a game this demanding the developers really need to support sli because with my 2 980ti's at 3440x1440 i get 20 fps on a mixture of high and low settings which after being out this long is pretty abismal to be honest. I mean cmon I run witcher 3 ultra hairworks on at that resolution getting 60+ fps. So if your the kind of gamer who games at 1080p and doesnt care if everything is on low settings then the game is fun! lots of fun but for me it just isn't i load the game up every now and then to see if performance has improved and nope same old 20 fps.,ARK: Survival Evolved,1,

5933,"2016-05-30",0,0,7448,1,1,My 2000+ hours show my obvious love for the game. This has to be the best early access that I have played. Yes it has its' bugs .. but they are minimal bearable and the devs are always quick to rectify the problem. With the addition of mods this game is now my favourite game. You can play it solo but for a better experience ... playing in a tribe is awesome. The emmersion in this game is 10/10. Highly recommend this to anyone and everyone.Like other games though .. it should be known that every user will have different experiences which are mostly determined by their computer specs. So the better you have the less you will experience many of the bugs that are only seen by users on lower end PC specs.,ARK: Survival Evolved,1,
5934,"2015-06-29",130,1795,189,1,1,Since most people are bashing the PvP servers for the griefing I feel like someone should answer that and also talk a bit about the PvE servers.Right now I got close to 130 hours in the game about half of that on PvP servers and half of that on PvE all official ones. All the thing people say about the griefers is true they'll kill your dinos steal your stuff abuse your body and destroy your house as soon as you go to sleep. In fact a lot of tribes organize group to play past midnight for the sole reason of hunting sleeping players. And that's the keyword here TRIBES. If you're playing on a PvP server you gotta keep in mind that you're not supposed to do it at your pace and take your time building your little Tatch hut with it's little thatch fence with your Raptor and a couple of Dilos. Slowly learning the game by yourself taking everything in eventually upgrading to Wood and then Stone and so forth.I'm sorry but I got to burst your bubble right now If you plan on playing in a PvP server you gotta take this game seriously. You either find a group of friends to play with you or you join a Tribe as soon as possible. If you play alone you might find a hidden spot where your stuf will be safe one or two nights maybe even a week but alone you're doomed to be found robbed and killed. And like many others said have the work of a whole week go down the drain. If you're joining a PvP server you're doing it for Tribe warfare and let me assure you thing can get really intense really epic pretty fast. With eagles swooping down to grab enemies and droping them from high altitues to their deaths or tactical droping Raptors inside their base to wreak havok T Rexes working as battering rams at the enemies gates while rockets fly at them auto turrets spewing bullets at your Carno army Sabretooths leaping over walls. It is a beauty to behold.But you'll only experience that if you join one of the dominating tribes on your server or work on creating a strong Tribe of your own. Otherwise you'll just be cattle for them nothing else. They'll keep you from taming dinos by killing them mid proccess block caverns so only they can harvest the resources literally kidnap you to use you as a blood bag Mad Max style and so on.I get why so much people hate that after all they're just being preayed upon they're not participating in all the fun that is Tribe Wars. But the only way to Tribe Wars be so much fun is allowing all this kind of freedom the game has right now they gotta allow people to be complete a holes because during wars that's what you gotta be. If they put too many safety nets to keep people who wanna do PvP only when THEY wanna do PvP the game would be boring and stale.But if everything I said right now put you off don't be. First of all because you don't really need PvP for this game to be fun. There's a TON of stuff to do in PvE servers or offline if you just wanna do everything at your pace. I got a bit tired of all the pressure on PvP servers and have been playing in a PvE for around 60 hours right now. And I still only got only a Wood base with some Dinos just hit level 45 and I feel like I'll never run out of things to do because the devs just keep adding and adding stuff almost each day. People are also very helpful on PvE servers they'll give you a hand when you have problems with a Rex help you gather Prime meat when you're taming a Carnivore give you tips and materials. At least on my server I got absolutely nothing to complain about them.And if you're still one of the guys who wanna grow at your pace and only participate on PvP when you're ready REJOICE! Because they'll soon add War Declaration to PvE servers so tribes can actually go at war when they feel like it without all the griefing to new players who want just to keep to themselves.As a closing statement I'd like to congratulate the Devs. They're doing a terrific job. Optimization is alreayd a LOT better still not there yet but much better. The content is fantastic and it just keeps coming. Bugs are rarer and rarer in fact I don't even remember the last time I experienced one.An all around great game that I fully recommend if you're into dinossaurs and survival games. Oh and it's also pretty cheap.,ARK: Survival Evolved,1,

5936,"2017-09-21",0,0,1983,0,1,"After so long I've decided to finally review this game. I bought this game shortly after it was up for sale in 2015 and the game has come a long time since then. Looking through these reviews talking about performance issues I can honestly say that I haven't had any performance issues since maybe early 2016 when the game was in its infancy still. My pc is 5 years old and it runs this on a mix of high/ultra at 60fps+. That's not to say the game doesn't have its issues bugs dupers and other botters but what game doesn't? It seems people are too lazy to google ""improve performance ark"" or something like that since there is a few easy things anyone can do to improve performance by a bit. I've played on both official and unofficial servers ill talk briefly about my experience.I've put in the bulk of my hours(1600 in fact) into one official server and while I love this game the official servers are brutal. Playing on these is a MASSIVE time investment and I mean MASSIVE. It takes a long time to do anything and starting on an official is brutal much more so if it's a pvp server.As far as unofficial servers go if you can find one with higher rates and a decent friendly community then you're all set get in there and enjoy the game.The bottom line is that yes the game has its issues as any other game does. There is a steady stream of content being added continuously and the game is ultimately fun. If you're on the fence about it don't take all the negative reviews for fact if you want to try it then jump in and try it. And unless you have alot of time or are a masochist then try find yourself a nice unofficial server to begin with.",ARK: Survival Evolved,1,
5937,"2017-04-01",0,0,867,1,0,The only reason I can gather that this game is immediately 67% off following the update is because nobody wants to play it anymore. Well done.Maybe if they undid some of the damage this past update just caused it would sell for more than $10. As it is they have been an early access game for 2 years and already have paid DLC which seems exploitative for the whole early access process. Finish the current game without spontaneously destroying your player base's experience would be my recommendation.,ARK: Survival Evolved,1,
5938,"2015-11-27",7,13,116,1,0,"Game goes like this Create character choose location spawn in and spend time looking around and scratching your arm where you are unable to move or act and a random carnivore starts to chase you if you lucky enough for it to be far enough away before you stop scratching your arm and looking around then you actually live to try outrun it and inevitably run into something else just as deadly... usually this is not the case before you are able to move you are one hit by said carnivore.Sometimes you are lucky enough to spawn in a less dangerous area like maybe in the snow where you quickly catch a cold and die.If you are lucky enough not to die by one of the 2 ways above then you probably will get stuck in the ground and have to wait till you die of starvation in order to randomly spawn again and probably die by one of the above.If you still manage to survive all of these things then lets talk about combat you manage to make a spear and try hunt something in order not to die of starvation you find something low enough lvl you can probably kill but unfortunately even though you are playing on a server where your ping is between 30 and 60 the animal teleports about and your miss stabs turn into exhaustion and you fall asleep the animal then kills you while you ""tor por"".I tried returning this game after playing it for 8 hours because I found it buggy and unplayable when I got stuck in the ground (and there is no unstuck command or suicide I even tried eating spoiled meat and my own feces) but they refused.So I thought what the hell ill give it another go guess what.. nope still a pile of feces. would definitely not recommend.",ARK: Survival Evolved,1,

5940,"2016-04-20",332,1264,1084,1,1,Note At least 1000 of my hours were spent on Official Servers. Thus my review will pertain to Official Servers.Ark Survival Evolved is a game that will make you feel many things. Initially you will feel frustration at your helplessness as you spawn nude on a beach at level one and can barely fend off the smallest of dinosaurs. Then you will meet people these people will either be total jerks and just kill you over and over or they will be really chill and you'll form a tribe with them. You will spend countless hours with these people farming materials taming dinosaurs and build bases. You will grow more and more in power. You will be meeting other players either passing through the server or settling down. You will know all the other tribes on the server that are worth knowing (i.e. the big tribes or friendly tribes). You will come across numerous other cultures as you find Chinese tribes and Spanish tribes French and German all while growing more and more powerful. You will on occassion have a set back but at this point you're on a roll and now the games mechanics have a good group of friends and objectives that you have given yourself. You will feel happy with what you have accomplished. But there is a downside. There must always be conflict while it can be delayed for long periods of time it will eventually come. And so another tribe will pick a fight with you. Your tribe will fight their tribe and you may lose or you may win. Either way you've invested a lot into this server and these friends so you'll never give up. Some other tribes will jointhe fight picking sides. The winning side will probably kill all the dinos take all the mats and kill everyone on the losing side. Thus you have won your first war. You are now a power on the server worth being reckoned with. Soon enough you'll get in an even bigger war as the losing side draws more and more people to aide them and you respond by getting more as well. Now the entire server is split 50 50 and a great war mars the server for days as both sides are constantly wiping one anothers bases. Eventually you'll win though and the other side will leave the server. They'll be fed up. As the enemies are now gone you are happy once more. You hated them just as they hated you. Now a long period of peace has passed a couple weeks. There is trouble brewing as a few of your allies are begin to grow wrestless and have infighting. Peace will try to be maintained through talks. But it will fail in the end and more war will arise. This cycle will continue until only 2 tribes remain. These two tribes will be dominant in every regard leadership tactics dinosaurs and materials. Pitted against one another to see who will rule the server. You will fight your heart out against your former allies. You will destroy bases you'd once entered as a friend now as an enemy. You will kill dinos whose names you helped come up with. You and your tribemates will be cycling out who gets to sleep because the battle will last over 24 hours. The fight will go on and on and on and on with no end. It will be exhilerating.Then you win. Then you are the supreme ruler of the server. You are standing over the ruins of your former allies as you have proved yourself to be the mightiest. But then it will hit you. The sadness. As now all the people you had once known months ago when you were just a little tribe starting out will all be gone. Everyone you'd ever fought with and fought against are gone. While there is some joy in victory it is very bitter as there is no one left to share it with. Your tribemates will still play but it's not the same. Even if not in your tribe you had a community. Friends. Foes. Maybe even lovers. Now all that is gone. You will pass the ruins of these once great tribes and feel a hole in your heart. New people will always arrive to challenge you but you'll always beat them down. Destroying any hope they had. You'll build fortresses that'll reach the Heavens and have so many dinos it'll cause server lag. You'll build Great Walls across vast territories in order to denote your power. Finally you'll get bored and leave.Months will pass and one day you'll see Ark still in your library and hop back on. You'll log back into your old server. Everything is different. New names faces bases everything. Not a single structure you had built is left standing not a single ruin. All of it is gone. The people on this server see you log in and ask if you want to join their tribe saying that 'Ark can be harsh for noobs' but you could never tell them. You could never tell them an entire servers history. The hundreds of thousands of hours of work you'd seen put in by that ancient world. The structures they couldn't ever even imagine. The wars you'd fought and people you'd met. You could never explain to them what it all had meant to you for it is all now gone. In it's place is a new world completely distinct from the original while maintaining a strong similarity. You will be both extremely happy at this new world and profoundly sad about the world that was lost.Ark Survival Evolved will demand dozens of hours to just get the basics down and get priorities straight. To become a power on a server will take about a hundred hours. To conquer a server will take a couple hundred hours. To realize everything you lost and destroyed that you once held dear will take thousands of hours. To atone for everything you'd done to those you once called friends will take an eternity.If you'll pour time and effort no game will ever make you feel as strongly about the decisions you've made than Ark Survival Evolved. Beware that you may get addicted and lose your real social life and ambitions in exchange for this game. But you'll meet people you'd never have met otherwise see things you never thought possible commit acts that would make tyrants think you're true evil or saints believe you are the second coming of Jesus Christ. In the end you'll feel stronger emotions then any you've ever felt from playing a game.10/10 Masterpiece.,ARK: Survival Evolved,1,
5941,"2015-09-18",946,1383,426,1,1,First review i wrote for a game but it had to be done!This game is like Crack! I've put a few hundred hours into this game and will probably put in a few hundred more. The devs are constantly pushing out new content (to a point where all the server maintenance is starting to become annoying haha) and they are very involved with the community trough reddit etc. Me and two friends of mine started off on a public server and had a really nice welcoming A nearby chinese tribe gave us some stuff to start out and we we're hooked to the game pretty much instantly. There were some big tribe wars going on on the server but we were left alone.A few weeks later. we have a huge metal base with a 5 high stone wall perimiter around it and 5 more people joined our tribe. All the big tribes but the chinese one left the server and got wiped out. And it seemed peaceful At this point we already spent hundreds of hours taming different dinos (which each have their different role like gathering resources carrying heavy loads transportation combat you name it) and we eventually also tamed a few t rexes and the stronger end game dino's. You name them all and because of their different tasks and stat builds you become sort of attached to your dino's as well which makes the game even better.One week later. Random (smaller tribes) are getting destroyed at night when they are offline. all the buildings blown open resources stolen and dinos killed. (take note some dinos can take over 10 hours to tame without kibble) At this point our base is more like a fortress we have over 70 organic turrets (think plants that split acid to hostiles) and 10 auto Gatlin turrets with loads of ammo in them. And an army of all kinds of dino's over 50 including 5 t rexes varying from lvl 150 200+ A fully metal layered base with different compartments with different resources in every room (makes it harder for raiders to get everything since they have to blow up more walls) The chinese tribe starts putting in random text in global chat in capital letters including our tribe name. they have always helped us out we have made multiple trades with them for resources and called them allies. The next day. I log on.Everything is gone.... all our dino's are dead every wall is blown up all our turrets taken out. and our base is in ruins. Hundreds of hours of building up Taming dino's training them taking them out on resource runs and working together with a tribe....gone....The chinese tribe who helped us out from day one Destroyed us.RIP.AtlasAbraxisNienTalonAeonMckittenMcCatMcMuffinMike the trikeBob the trikeArmageddonMorgothApocalypse AnkrahmunAnkaderpMuffinDeemDemonspawnSharkenatorLuluRammusRockeyStoneyScorpenatorMittenRappyOmegaMammutanWoollyMamenamenamenanCarnyBrontenatorAnd many more....That empty hollow feeling seeing your base in ruins and all your tamed fed and cared for dino's dead. I never had that before in a game.3 days later. we set up camp a few miles west from our old base. we had primitive tools and we were back to square one. But we we're determined and longing for revenge.... we broke down some old metal walls en made a small 4x4 room and set up the basic crafting stations. We had good contact with a few of the smaller tribes nearby who we helped out countless of times. now we needed their help. we secretly banded together against the Chinese tribe and they gave us some of the harder to obtain resources like crystal and oil.We started mass producing grenades.I went out at night with a stash of metal tools a crossbow arrows and food and approached their base. The chinese built a enormous stone castle on the water where they stored most of their Egg farm dino's in. I went to the beach. swam underneath the base. found a spot where i could hack away at their stone walls to get inside. Found a good spot and made a start. tribe members brought over grenades and we blew though the wall. Out came charging a T rex and 5 raptors at insane speed. we started backing off while firing at them. The water slowed them down. Called for the rest of the tribe to head over. we ended up fighting them on foot with primitive weapons. After a long fight we took them out one by one and eventually they all lay dead. That feeling of Vengeance is undescribable. but we weren't satisfied. We headed back into the dino pen and laid waste to their entire egg farm we killed over 20 Stego's three mammoths and a few ankylo's It was a massacre. Fueled by the loss of our pets and friends. Today we're still fighting a guerrilla style war against the Chinese. Constantly on the move hitting them where they expect it the least.Only a handfull of people remain on the server but we won't rest untill we have taken everything from them... like they did to so many others.Apoligies for the grammar mistakes etc. English is not my native language.,ARK: Survival Evolved,1,

Been gaming since the Atari... been online since the early 90's. Done everything from chat based roleplay to full blown massive MMO's. I have a few hundred games on Steam and others on Origin GoG etc.Let me say that this is the FIRST time I have EVER seen a developer quite like this one.Make no mistake this is an Early Access title. So of course the launch was plagued with issues and the server numbers didn't cover the 100 000+ players... BUT the devs have made some of the most aggressive moves to resolve the issues that I've ever seen.In the first 24 hours of the game... we had over a dozen patches. In the first 48 hours... I can't even count how many. I recall yesterday having downloaded over 10 different patches through Steam. Seemed like one every hour. For me that's HUGE. A developer that actually TRIES to set the example and improve on their product. You just don't see this type of response at all from an indie or AAA team.That said... the game is pretty fun and exciting. I'd describe it best as Rust with dinosaurs. Only the quality of the game is far superior being on the Unreal 4 engine. The fps numbers may be pretty low for most users but chock that up to poor optimization (which is expected of an Early Access title only a few days into release).In all you can't go wrong picking this title up at this point. Just make sure your system requirements meet the 1 and you should be fine.,ARK: Survival Evolved,1,

But after playing this game for 8 9k hrs and willingly surviving all manner of bugs cheats and trolling I have found the 1 thing that I think is unnacceptable in any game which is the ability of other players to completely shut you out of the game. I am currently in someone's base cuffed to a bed being fed and watered and under ACs so I can't even play move kill myself or otherwise. Like I said I have a lot of hrs so pls don't explain to me how to kill myself in these situations assume I have tried it all. I am literally losing 0 food or water sitting here online for over a day now. I left my computer on to see what would happen and sure enough I'm still losing no stats because of this environment. Somehow my character has decided to also stop defecating so there is no way to die at all. I can't even be rescued/killed by my team because I am in a glitched location where the tribe has a giga parked inside biting through walls. While I feel someday the devs might actually listen and ban cheaters/make this form of prolongued capture bannable atm I am the tribe leader of a tribe that has no ability to play. I am not starting a fresh character and supporting a game that thinks this is gameplay. If you aren't actually playing it is not gameplay. I am sitting here not losing a single stat in a survival game FOR HOURS. Pls fix your game. I have accepted flying dino corpses ppl undermeshing my base ppl aimbotting me and my dinos megatribes etc... but losing your character like this? its ridiculous,ARK: Survival Evolved,1,

Just to be clear I have 8gb RAM an NIVIDIA Geforce GTX 560 and a CPU of 3.1 GHz. I know this is not great but it's not THAT bad either. I tried everything that should help me according to internet and put all settings on the lowest possible so the graphics look like a game that was made in the nineties. And STILL my pc freezes for 5 to 10 seconds whenever I run or whenever there is a moving object (like a dinosaur) in front of me. Honestly I want my money back..,ARK: Survival Evolved,1,
5963,"2017-06-08",0,0,1751,1,0,Really bad game.It is unfortunate as ARK had SO much potential when it began. The freedom to explore and build was fulfilling. Interaction with neighboring tribes was a social experiment. It was really fun to have long term goals to achieve difficult tasks through planning and to work as a team.Unfortunately Wildcard SUCKS with customer support. Any software requires a corrective actions process to fix bugs administer servers interact with the user group etc... Wildcard has poured all of their effort and resources into new models new skins new features and NOTHING into fixing glitches or exploits. They release game changing new models (tek) that WRECK the game... and provide almost no apologies or fixes. Every release seems to be in favor of the griefers and the exploiters who destroy the economic balance by duping glitching under the map using server lag to their advantage denial of service attacks etc... The ability to move resources across servers without first providing human referees and administrators MONITORING GAME PLAY was a STUPID idea. Providing tek transmitters that can be placed UNDER THE MAP with no server admins on duty 24/7 is completely irresponsible.Unlike other massively multiplayer online games (UO WOW EVE LOTR TF CS...) Wildcard slapped a beta label on a two year old game in order to bybass any responsibility of maintaining their servers. When you play the game you WILL be greifed by a cheater. There is NO recourse. Months of effort will vanish at 4 AM by a handful of cockroach players who spent a few hours grinding weapons that when combined with any of a hundred exploits will bypass your defenses. Your five generations of dino breeding will be wiped in minutes. 200 auto turrets on redundant power generators will be completely impotant as griefers slide into a map glitch and attack your base from underneath the map. They will bring a T rex from an unofficial server to an official server (dup exploit) during a major patch deployment with health 50x what is allowed... and wipe the dinos you took MONTHS to raise. You will watch your favorite dino fall through the map never to be seen again. Your best bird will die as your client lags out and fall to earth. There as SO MANY THING WRONG WITH THIS GAME.IF there was a full time admin present on each server that would respond to these problems and restore your hard work it would be an awesome game. BUT when you fill out a ticket with WildCard they will tell you that it is a beta and you are screwed. They have only rolled back servers when evidence of MASSIVE exploits are so painfully obvious they have to step in. Think about that their only recourse is to restore to a snapshot. That's it. They apparently have no parallel database tracking individual objects IN A TESTING ENVIRONMENT.Seriously don't waste your time. If ARK gets bought out by a larger more professional company (Blizzard EA)... then they will spend money on the support layer. But WildCard has proven to be completely incompetent in this area. Don't give them any more funding EVER.,ARK: Survival Evolved,1,

5966,"2017-05-19",0,0,2612,1,0,"The premise of this game is amazing but the execution is absolutely embarrassing. Even for an early access game ARK is far too broken to be 1 to anyone. The balance issues are extremely prohibitive. Taming a dinosaur takes literal hours even for experienced players and most species are useless while some are far too overpowered. Once you have a base and some dinosaurs you can expect to have to log in at least every few days to keep your structures and animals from ""timing out"" and being deleted.There are bugs and glitches within every single mechanic of this game. I've had 30 dinos disappear at once. I've had many dinosaurs starve to death next to troughs full of food. I've had dinosaurs get stuck hundreds of feet in the air or get pushed below the terrain never to be seen again. I've had my character get stuck underground or in my own walls. The devs have claimed to fix all these bugs multiple times but they keep happening.And not suprisingly customer support is non existant. Lost dinos or your whole base to a known bug? Too bad. When not IF ARK destroys hours of your work don't expect anything more than a half arsed copy/paste ""sorry.""The developers of this game are far more interested in pushing unfinished and over priced expansion packs than they are in actually fixing anything in the core game. This is not worth your time or money now or possibly ever.",ARK: Survival Evolved,1,
5967,"2017-05-29",0,0,573,1,0,This game started out pretty fun and has the potential to be. However what it has boiled down to are griefers running around destroying your bases and killing your dinos for lols. This wouldn't be an issue if it was more difficult to destroy something than it is to build it however it is so laughably easy to offline raid a base that there is no point in even attempting to build anything unless you are in a mega tribe with 20 players. Not to even mention that troll builds have players sprinting around at insane speeds with the ability to knock you out in one hit with a wooden club regardless of your armor. The community has just gotten more and more toxic since release.TLDR Game is full of griefers and promotes griefing by design. Stay away.,ARK: Survival Evolved,1,

Solid gameplay in a fun environment.Cannot recommend however a lot of people have mentioned the high price and releasing DLC while still in alpha which is all bad practice the thing that has me not recommending this game is the many bugs and constant crashes combined with the 15min load times. I don't want to have to play another game or watch netflix while i wait for a game to load to only have it crash 5mins later.I may play this one again once these issues have been resolved but i'm not going to get my hopes up.,ARK: Survival Evolved,1,
5970,"2016-09-15",0,0,98,1,0,alright so I've played the game and had fun with it BUT its buggy as hell honestly I would give the main game a sideways thumb if I could. Its fun interesting massive tons of things you can do but the bugs are terrible when you run into them and unless you have a group of people you play with and only play this game it takes forever to get any progress. I probably would have ended up giving this a thumbs up but like so many others have pointed out paid DLC in early access. usually I could let this go but from what I've seen the DLC is more polished than the main game at this point that is a massive middle finger to the people who supported the game. Just a quick tip for the Devs perfect what you started before you perfect the side project.,ARK: Survival Evolved,1,
5971,"2017-08-29",0,0,222,0,0,You won't see a lot of what the game proposes in their trailers and screenshots. I certainly didn't. It's a massive time sink because on standard servers it takes what feels like about 20 years to do anything. That's how I managed 222 hours. The Dev team has also made it clear that they do not give a damn about their player base. They only care about the money. Which brings me to another point the $60 price tag. I got it on sale and I felt like it was overpriced even at $30 during the Early Access days. Buggy as all hell with the original problems never actually getting resolved just content update after content update adding more and more to the problems already there. It's a shame that it's held down by these issues because the concept of the game is great. The biggest mechanic the taming of dinosaurs and other creatures is awesome. It's a shame that the rest of the game doesn't work half the time. Eventually it got to the point where I needed mods in a single player format for me to squeeze out any enjoyment out of this game. Oh and don't even think about trying to play this game without at LEAST a pretty good PC setup. Mine's OK and can barely pump out this game with decent settings but a fair few people will have trouble getting this game to run with even decent looking graphics let alone what the screenshots promise. Not worth $60.,ARK: Survival Evolved,1,

Well you'd find that with this.However what you won't find with this game is good frame rate regardless with how low your resolution is. The optimization is horrid and rather than delivering a fix for it the developers have found that releasing DLC is more important.It's understandable that games will react that way if you have a poor PC and specs that are too fancy HOWEVER if you can run intensive games on Ultra such as Dishonored 2 Fallout 4 GTA V Middle Earth Arma 3 etc and NOT be able to run this game there is an ISSUE.Even tinkering with the settings setting them to medium or low and then flying away from any graphical clutters from dinosaurs spawned is not enough to keep the game's frames from being staggering then there's something in the game that needs fixing.But hey let's have some new DLC instead of optimization shall we?This is a wonderful game but I can not enjoy it because of the lack of work on it.,ARK: Survival Evolved,1,

5989,"2017-03-10",0,0,446,1,0,"There are a great many options in the survival crafting genre. It's worth noting that most started at ARK and then fixed the glaring weaknesses. It's unforgiving in both good and lazy ways. Hostiles are... hostile. That's a great unapologetic quality. However it actively supports griefing in ways that are literally impossible to defend against. In virtually every official server all starting spawn locations are walled off and every inch prevented from building. This makes the server unplayable. Only 1 if you find an active server with a devoted admin as much game playability depends on them.Additionally there is no ""offline"" when you log in you'll usually find yourself long since dead and often with your base destroyed even on PVE servers. If you're into ""unforgiving"" and the concept that there really is no sense of safety that's a feature. If you prefer to be able to log off and breath a little easily it's a frustration. Years of work can be destroyed in a few minutes with no recourse.Pros Dinosaurs are cool. Seriously they're huge intimidating and amazing.Reasonably varied terrain.The ""polish"" is pretty... well... pretty. Dinosaurs really are epic from sight to sound. Water elements are very well done. Even on low settings the scenery and terrain are well rendered.There are seriously challenging ""end game"" targets.Cons No punishment or protection from grifeing. Most servers are unplayable for newbies within a day or two as all spawns are walled in and locked.No intelligent respawn. You can easily respawn in a base and be unable to even kill yourself to move out or die before you finish spawning in.Virtually all gameplay resolves to ""find dinosaur. tame dinosaur"" as you advance.Minimal weapon and armor choices. There really isn't specialization in skill advancement. All characters are the same.Servers are massively overburdened by controlling the hostile fauna. You'll get 15 second lag consistently and virtually all fights will involve animals warping around as you wonder where to swing at. Action resolution will take a very long time and you'll often find yourself warped back in time 30 seconds.A poor engine that doesn't gracefully resolve client/server position/action disputes an issue that's been solved since 1995.Comparisons Conan is a reskinned version of this with much better skill and item diversity but virtually no middle/end game hostile diversity.7 Days to Die is a much more varied survival horror crafting game with bases having more depth and modern weapons.

I AM SO OUT THE AMOUNT OF TIME I HAVE SUNKEN INTO THIS GAME FOR ABSOLUTELY NO ING REWARD AT ALL. I don't ever take the time to write game reviews but for this game I will. I payed a whopping 66$ for this game only to find it riddled with bugs and just general things that NEED to be fixed. &amp then I realize this is the full release and not even the alpha.. and I don't know how the dev's aren't completely embarassed of what has turned out. They took a great idea and butchered the execution in every way possible and now it seems as though they don't even give a about the game or the people who have overpayed for it. Almost EVER SINGLE SERVER has been capped for dinosaur tames since the servers can only handle so many. The problem with this is super groups just hop on servers and take up ALL the tame slots so any new player coming on the server CAN'T EVEN PLAY THE GAME FOR ONE OF IT'S MAIN FUNCTIONALITIES. HOW ON EARTH ARE THE DEVS ALLOWING THIS. This is rubbish as far as I'm concerned and these devs are the exact type of devs that people do not want in the future.

6012,"2017-09-16",1,4,90,0,0,What is Ark Survival Evolved?Ark is a survival game set on an island inhabited by dinosaurs and other prehistoric creatures. And dodos.To survive on this Island you have to eat drink and build a shelter to withstand the cold of the night. Of course you also need weapons to defend yourself from the creatures of the Island and maybe even from other players.With nearly everything you do you get experience and levelups. With each level up you get a certain amount of skill points and engram points. With skill point you are able to increase your stats. With the engram points you are able to unlock newengrams (blueprints) to craft new items or objects. Another rather important thing is the possibility to tame the creatures. Therefore you need to get them unconscious and then feed them until the taming bar is filled. Depending on the type of food the bar feels faster but nevertheless it takes very long until it is completely filled. To ride the animal you also need a suitable saddle.The problemsEven though the may be fun to play there are way to many things that lower or even destroy the fun you could have with the game.The first thing are many bugs that occure and since the game is now released from Early Access im most certain those things wont be fixed.The next thing and probably the most important one is the performance. Since the beginning of the game in its Early Access phase the game suffered from a very poor performance. The developers promised ever since to improve it. Not only that they also promised to release a patch to support DirecX 12 which also should improve the performance. But till the present day the performance is still terrible and it seems like the plans for the DirecX 12 patch are comletely gone.The last thing I want to point out are the developers. Even though they knew of those problems they just made promises. They released a few patches which increased the performance. But not enough. They made patches which fixed some bugs. But not enough. They decided that it was more important to release content like new creatures or new objects to craft. And then they decided that it was more impoertant to use the money they got for finishing their game to make an expansion. An expansion which is not more than a new map with little changes to the gameplay.The conclusionArk Survival Evolved was a promising game at the beginning of its Early Access Phase. But as it went on the developers carried on to destroy it. And with the release of the expansion it was clear that the developers gave up on the game and just wanted to make money with it. And then they even decided to release it in its current state. I can't recommend this game and I honestly can't understand people who recommend it.,ARK: Survival Evolved,1,
6013,"2017-06-27",0,0,45,1,0,I'll start by saying that when Ark is fun it's fantastic.But there is so many problems with the game. 1. The official servers are impossible to play on.2. Private servers with friends are fun but there's so much grinding.3. Private servers on your own are boring because it's just grinding. 4. This might just be my PC but even at minimum graphics on a private solo server I get so much lag that last time I played it killed me. Right as I was getting on an icthy to run from a plesiosaur it dropped to 2 fps and I died after grinding for 5 hours to get scuba gear an icthy and a plesiosaur saddle and more that I had with me because it was all part of taming the plesiosaur. 5.

You're not going to get anywhere with casual play. Being vulnerable when you're logged off is immersive but not realistic. Having to worry about losing your life and possessions while not playing it is unreasonable although an interesting tactic to force people to log on as much as possible. While I appreciate the challenging nature of Ark the comittment required is unrealistic for people who actually have a life outside gaming. Plan on spending many hours harvesting crafting and taming only to have everything you worked for taken away from you in an instant by a random dino or malicious player. Speaking of malicious players Ark is a classic social experiment to see what happens when people are without laws and morals. It runs parallel to the book ""Lord of the Flies"" or the TV Show ""Walking Dead"" where the worst side of people emerges when survival is at stake. You will likely be a victim of simulated harassment bullying terrorism and even slavery from other players. Sound fun?The concept of this game is an intriguing one.

6019,"2018-02-02",0,0,1091,0,0,ARK my summed up thoughts that hopefully will influence your decision to buy.. or not buy ARK and it's DLCARK is a progressive game with gathering and surviving as well as taming creatures to help your ventures.The upsides and downsides to ARK with minor comparisons to other games if you can understand where I come from in some personal views and how it ties into this reivew.I'm not going to sugar coat it at all the worst part about ARK is how poorly optimized it is to crashes on a regular basis and poor framerates despite having having a beastly computer set upand for people who don't have a fairly good computer my heart goes out to you my tribemates typically ran with less than 30 frames and their crashes were more common than mine along with these problems finding the motivation to play ARK after you enter/leave a cave and your game crashes and your game crashes every time this is such a simple optimization fix the game tries to unload and load everything around you they could have changed it to load slower I have a beastly computer and loading in and out of caves is awful I got at least 4 5 second game freezes when loading in and out of caves ontop of the caves having your tamed creatures glitch out of the map or in your base foundation is by far the worst you either have to destroy most of your base to get your tamed creature out or let it die and if your tamed creature glitches under the map it's as good as gone.The above issue of your creature glitching out of the map can be fixed by contacting an admin and having them teleport it out but... this is only a viable option if you play on a non official server otherwise you're SOLThe second biggest issue which is as big as the first one in my opinion if you play on a official server you can transfer your character and tamed creatures and items from server to server which is required to obtain DLC specific items and tamed creatures however this opens up a ton of community problems anyone with a high level character/creature can join a server (usually a group of people) and destroy everything in a server within a few hours and believe me this may destroy your motivation to play i've had my large base with a lot of creatures destroyed within a few hours.The last problem if you haven't gotten frusturated with poor frames or optimization issues or your creatures glitching out of the map what makes losing your creatures and bases worse is how long it takes to get them/build up a high level creature can take sometimes up to 5 hours to tame this is a game for Youtubers who can record and make cut content of the game that may seem appealing when it may not be or you're a no life in a basement somewhere this isn't a game where you can pickup and put down as you want it the only acception would have to be is if a large number of people were extremely cooperative with eachother and took turns on a schedule and even then this may detract from the enjoyment of the game as raids may make you worry or give you anxiety even when not on.1 Poor optimization2 Transfer greifing3 This game will suck a lot of your timeif this game had it's serious optimization issues/bugs fixed instead of them adding more content I would recommend getting this if you are more of a social person not everyone is cancer (small amount but noteworthy) quite a bit of social people play on ARK and may give a somewhat more enjoyable gameplay experience,ARK: Survival Evolved,1,

I mean most dinos can survive ingame centuries without eating... WTF?! Resource farming ... you pickup a small stone about as big as your mouse +1 Stone. You hit a rock bigger than a car about 5 times and get about 20 stones and the rocks literally EXPLODES! Ugly textures if I haven't mentioned these.

I love the concept of what Ark is supposed to be I've dropped a lot of hours in the game for the short time it's been out and would do it again. This is where the but part comes in. I'm not going to completely pick this game apart because it's E.A. and I get that but it's going to be kinda close. There are a few things I want to see in this game before I go back to playing it.The Short verison welcome to Grinding Similator 2015 and Dino Prom date! ""she'll leave you when you go to the bathroom and never come back"" 2010/10 would play Destiny again because the grinding doesn't feel like you're getting dumped by the love of your life every time you play. Still love this game and will play again but right now we've agreed to take a break.The ranting truth long version.1) I want a Tribe alliance system like June 1st 2015. This way Tribe Chieftains meet accecept the pact and you have a better way of knowning who your are allies rather then ""Yeah sure we're friendly where is are you basesasuars?""2) The Griefing is a bit much. I've played 7 Days To Die and the PVP is real in that game. I've spawned in this and 7DTD and had to start over again. Now to be honest I'd rather start over on 7 Day's because I don't have to spend at least 6 hours just chopping wood to make a hut to live in. I wouldn't mind the grief so much if I didn't need to spend so much time rebuilding and getting back up and running. The other thing is this the defending of the base when you're offline is completely terrible. I have to hope my Dinos aren't aggro'd away from base a left in the wilds someone didn't stand on the back of a trike and shoot over the walls and killed them and finally the dinos decided to go on a camping trip and left base. Honestly building a base in this game right now is pointless either your dinos can't defend themselves and die or someone gets smart leads your 4 Rex's and everything else away from base and it's happy raiding. Right now I still haven't thought of a way to fix the issue without buffing the walls HP and resistances.3) Building is fun I like making forts and and learning from mistakes when my base is obliterated more then likely my fault I didn't think of something and that's why I'm spending 6 hours rebuilding a hut. The amount of materials needed to build a decent base in the world is insanely high compared to what you get out of it in return and takes about 10 minutes to go through if it's a wood base and you have a half decent trike. Now let me clear that up that's 10 minutes to completely level someones base. The snap system of building is Meh at best for example building on the side of a hill I put down the foundations just fine knew that have to switch to support beams and did. Now I have the base done and started putting up metal. Watch one side of wall completely fall off just cause and then could rebuild because the hole of open space was obstructed. So either tweak the building system or scrap it and start fresh because I spend more time building and when I'm not doing that I'm sitting down tamming a dino for 2 hours just to have it die in 2 minutes because I turned my back and a dilo spawned next to it and attacked taking the trike out in the wild to die by Shenainigains. The amount of resources needed to make walls and such should be reduced and I find grinding of Kertine/Chitin in game to be disturbing.4) Dinos are awesome when they are alive and so much fun the downside is they suffer from a mental handicap which makes tamming them practically useless to have around because once your base is rebuilt you're back to tamming your dinos which takes any where from 5 minutes for a Dodo to 5 hours of my real life to tame a T rex. Which honestly sitting there watching something raise it's head to eat for that long is stupid boring. I mean I could be rebuilding my base. The worst part of this is the fact you can aggro a horde of dinos away from base and they won't return to the last place they were told to not follow at. I've lost a lot of dinos that way for no reason. Simply add in to the commands to stay or return location with a 50ft radius of pursuit when attacked so they don't chase to the ends of the world.So now the good part. I like how the game looks the survival aspect is pretty much on point I like the current dino's so far though a huge beaver and bigfoot seem kind of lame additions. The crafting system is easy to get a hang of and the leveling is nice. Game is a lot of fun with friends and makes getting started only take 3 full days of your real life rather then almost a full week.",ARK: Survival Evolved,1,

However after the recent DLC announcement I can certainly not recommend the game. Removing Survival of the Fittest from free to play to a purchasable title is one thing but releasing DLC for a game that has not yet exited Early Access is laughable. The developers response was even worse citing that they had always planned to do this. If you want to test DLC and your game is in Early Access fine but it should be free.

The truth is ARK has a lot of work and so far the way the development team has responded to the issues arising with the game and the wishes of the community has left a lot of the community unsatisfied. I reccomend waiting this game out see if the devs can better evaluate the situation and realize the right direction to take the game from here.,ARK: Survival Evolved,1,
6104,"2015-07-16",0,0,123,1,0,UPDATE The game is still very buggy the lag is still present but at times worse as the server cant even keep 10 people on one server from having severe lag constantly then you have these idiots that go around and put pillars everywhere so that no one can find a spot to build the devs need to address this issue quickly the dinos arent running through my house anymore yet you start as a lvl 1 and will have lvl 116 birds come from the sky and attack up non stop at the early stages this being said the devs still have yet to address real issues they feel its more important to keep pushing out new content while they are turning a blind eye to the acts people are using to grief others to the point they cant even play the game also when they do updates that dont require client restarts if your on your flying mount you are automatically dismounted in air to fall to your death then you cant find your mounts anymore also in my case my first week back to try the game yet again i had to relocate my base 3 times because the devs kept changing the boundary lines for the updates they put out so in a short if you like the devs ing you up or like being griefed by other players in PVE not just PVP then this game is the bucket of youve been waiting for.Still would not recommend this to anyone at the current point In the games current state I would suggest that you hold off on your purchase of said product. The game is fun when playable. However there are alot of server issues with the game in its current state where the lag spikes can get you killed in more ways then one for example i was swimming the server hit a huge lag spike my character then was dead by the time the lag subsided from drowning another time i was out harvesting items to build my house when yet another lag spike reared up and i was attacking my a group of raptors and by time the spike went away yet again i was dead.Other game breaking issues that still havent been fix are the fact the dinos can kill you through walls inside your house when your not there then when you log in your house is not destroyed but youve been killed in my case this has happened 3 different times on one very fustrating occasion i logged in to being killed and having all of my items missing from my house even though my house was still intact so i was apparently killed through walls and the dinos destroyed all the items in my house not anyone else as this was a PVE server and not a PVP server. And today i logged into having been killed again by dinos but to top it off my home was filled with rocks to the point I couldnt enter or exit or get to my chests to create a item with which to break them with. Im tired of seeing these developers adding in new content while failing to prioritize the game killing bugs like the ones mentioned above. these devs are not addressing any of the major issues instead they keep pouring in more and more content ( which is good for a finished product) but in this case they are not holding themselves up to a level of detail that I myself would claim to be professional the content adding should be halted until they have the major issues fixed.If you dont care about losing hours of work or dying in your home from dinos that seem to be like casper the ghost and your not easily fustrated at things like that then this game maybe fun for you if your like me who has PTSD and gets upset because your dying from random things like server lag and dinos that go through walls then i suggest you save you money and spend it else where on a finished product that has good reviews.this game has good reviews but to many are fan boys who adobt games early and can find no flaws or just dont care that there money is spent on good quality products so as of now i cannot recommend this game knowning that is has major issues that alot of people are not addressing.,ARK: Survival Evolved,1,
6105,"2015-06-17",6,78,17,1,0,In its current state my first hour was met with poor FPS on the lowest of settings Dinosaurs that glitched around when trying to fight them and then if I could manage to kill them the corpses had a habit of just soaring off into the sky.You start out naked without any clue of what to do I punched a dodo and lost health with every hit I punched it for meat losing health on every hit I punched a tree for wood to make an axe lost health doing so. Using your bare hands causes you to lose life while harvesting or fighting which is insanely stupid. I could understand after a few hits if you lost a little life for your hands being all bloody but still.At one point while chasing a floating corpse I fell into the rock texture and got stuck for a minute. After some jumping and trying to escape being stuck inside the rock texture I freed myself only to find my vigorous excercise left me starving and rapidly losing health because of it.The food bar depleats way way too quickly. I get its supposed to be survival and that running and such makes you hungrier than normal but not even one day/night cycle left me out of food multiple times.TL DR Looks great on epic settings optimization lacking.Buggy very buggy.,ARK: Survival Evolved,1,
6106,"2019-01-24",3,210,58,0,1,Dear Devs thanks for taking your time and making the right call to fine tune the game. I think a lot of developers can learn from your example. A really excellent sequel and you have proven that some companies can consistently produce excellent 40k games.,Battlefleet Gothic: Armada 2,1,
6107,"2019-01-24",1,159,9,0,1,Product received for free. Engaging and accessibleBattlefleet Gothic Armada 2 is an RTS set in the Warhammer universe developed Tindalos Interactive a follow up to their 2016 game. While I have played several Warhammer games I m not very familiar with the lore or the stories so if you re curious about how it holds up in universe this isn t the right review to read. That being said I was impressed by how easy it was to get into the game but also how easy it was to get into the story. Positives The graphics are great but what s really impressive is the level of detail here. I ve been playing on medium settings and I was quite surprised to see the level of detail there is for the different ships. It s better than a lot of other RTS games I ve played. The battles look cool too they're fun to watch which is obviously quite important.One of my favorite parts of the game is you can pretty much choose for yourself how much you want to micromanage. If you want to you can just tell your ships where to move or what to attack and sit back and watch them occasionally clicking to activate an ability or something. But if you re a big RTS player and you like having a lot of control you can micromanage quite a few different things for each ship in your fleet. You can set the engagement range of your ship you can set which part of a ship you want your ship to target (targeting weapons lowers their firepower targeting engines lowers their manoeuvrability etc.) you can change the priority of a target which side you want to attack from and a couple of other things too. I ve pretty much stuck to just choosing which part of a ship to target and leave it at that but I like that there s so many options.The single player campaigns are quite engaging. At the time of writing this I haven t been able to play the Tyranid campaign (it wasn t available in the beta build) but the Necron and Imperium of Man campaigns are equally well made and engaging. The voice acting and writing is good and I like how the campaign maps work. I personally prefer the Necron campaign but that s just because their story interests me a little more and I prefer how their ships work.The campaign map is basically where you see what your goals are where your fleets and enemy fleets are and it s how you move your fleets to attack targets to take over systems. Your fleets have a set number of movement points that allow you to jump to systems connected to the one your fleet is currently in. My only complaint with the campaign map is that there are a few things that would really benefit from having tooltips that show up when you hover over them. For example systems have points of interest that can be upgraded. The problem is I can t tell you what the upgrades do because I don t know the game hasn t told me.Having three separate campaigns with three very different campaigns adds some great variety to the game. I was feeling frustrated with how I was doing in the Imperium campaign so I started the Necron campaign and was right back to enjoying it.In the campaign you earn renown for every battle you finish. This renown can be spent on adding new fleets unlocking new ship tonnages or on technologies that upgrade your stuff. I will say renown does seem to be earned quite slowly especially early on but I like this way of getting upgrades.I haven t played multiplayer but the balance in singleplayer seems pretty good. From what I ve played so far I haven t found anything that feels particularly over or underpowered even the small support ships are quite helpful. I also think the pace of the game is quite good especially as you can pause half speed double speed or triple speed. Also it s worth mentioning that you can issue orders while the game is paused (in singleplayer) I wasn t expecting to be able to it s nice to see.While the three campaigns are restricted to a specific faction there are nine more playable factions in the skirmish mode.There is an auto battle option if there s a fight you really don t want to do. Seeing as this is an RTS game I m not sure how many people are going to want to skip the whole fighting thing but it s nice to have it available anyway.Negatives The maps are a bit sparse. I mean I get that it s space but you re basically just in a chunk of skybox with a planet way off in the background. There are some things on the maps such as gas clouds and debris fields (you can hide your ships in these which is nice) but I just felt like the maps were missing something. I guess my issue is there s not much that differentiates the maps but maybe I m expecting too much from a game set in space.As I mentioned earlier there really need to be tooltips/more explanation for things. I m a few hours in at this point and there are still UI elements or parts of the campaign that I just don t understand. There s no ship customization here as far as I can tell. You do have quite a few options when building new ships (as long as you have a good enough shipyard) but you can t change what weapons a certain ship has. I wasn t too bothered by this personally but I feel others might take issue with it.There's really not much in the way of mission variety in the campaigns. So far every mission I've seen is either 'destroy the enemy fleet' or 'destroy the enemy fleet or reach the strategic point goal'. It needs some more mission types. Verdict While I have had a couple of issues with this game I m quite impressed by it overall and I ve been enjoying it more than I expected to. This is a great space/Warhammer RTS that has surprisingly good single player content. I think the price is pretty fair based on the content and polish here if you re a fan of RTS games or more generally space or Warhammer games I recon this is worth picking up.

6112,"2019-02-03",5,72,40,0,0,"I wish Steam has a ""meh"" opinion instead of just yes or no.Pros 1. Beautiful looking game. This has to be one if not the most beautiful 40K game out there. The devs put a lot of effort into making this game look like a movie. It is absolutely gorgeous.2. Wonderful storytelling. In fact this is the first and only 40K game set in the 8th Edition setting. Comes with 3 campaigns each with their own gameplay style and features. You get to meet important characters from the setting like Bobby G and and his aeldari whatever she is and some returning characters from Battlefleet Gothic Armada. 3. Good inheritance of the naval gameplay from Battlefleet Gothic Armada now with even more ships and factions! 12 different factions to play with (even though there are only 3 campaigns the devs said they are working on the fourth one). Now for the Cons 1. Campaign fleet management is based off of multiplayer balancing. It just doesn't make sense. In Battlefleet Gothic Armada you can customize each and every one of your ships giving it different skills and upgrades. Currently upgrades are based off of an upgrade tree and skills comes with the captain thus making the skills only available to the flagship and no longer customizable. I can understand putting upgrades in an upgrade tree I'd even say it is an improvement but I think the skills should be available2. QoL features needed Upgradable planets tracking invasion tracking and such features should be implemented. When you have 6 7 sectors in your hand and each of them has 2 3 invasions incoming it is very hard to keep track of everything.3. Bugs There are quite a few bugs in the game. Not quite gamebreaking but can be extremely annoying to find out for example the Archeo Gellar Field in Obsidian Depths doesn't stop invasions on Nemesis Tessera even if evolved to level 3 or playing a mission and suddenly finding missingstring texts or French out of the blue. These should be fixed ASAP.I would probably give it a 6/10 at its current stage add your own bonus points depending on how much you like 40K. Once some of the more glaring issues are fixed this will definitely go up.",Battlefleet Gothic: Armada 2,1,
6113,"2019-01-26",6,202,88,0,0,I'd like to be clear that this is a mixed review and I wish Steam had a mixed response button. The tactical ship to ship action is great and in a lot of ways better than the last game ships are tougher loadouts like torpedoes are effective but limited in uses and lighter ships like escorts are actually useful. I do wish they'd inlcuded more mission types but overall it's a big thumbs up.The strategic map is disappointing and it's disappointing mainly because it appears to have so much potential. The first game was a series of missions with filler coming from attacks on your territory this second game gives you a whole map to move around in ship yards to occupy defences to build and somehow feels exactly the same. To give some examples Occupation is always a simple matter of moving your fleets into the system and killing whatever is there. The AI can't do this and announces its rare intentions to attack your territory a turn beforehand so all your fleets can intercept them. Defences can be instantly built delaying the AI attack and making building any defences before an attack is coming pointless. The AI can't delay your attacks with defences but can limit your fleet size to two instead of three fleets seeing as there's a limit on how much you can deploy at once that makes virtually no difference. There's no way to delete an unwanted fleet and it will still cost upkeep. Because of fleet limits it's impossible for Necron fleets to recruit cruisers when they initially get access to cruisers.All this makes it feel like you're playing Windows Chess on beginner mode. What could be a meaty important part of the game is reduced to a series of admittedly fun tactical battles but they aren't enough to make the game feel solid on its own.The game is beautiful and sounds great the tearing metal of hull against hull and the flash of void shields being hit with macro weapons are enjoyable on their own.I hope this review is helpful. I'm certainly still going to play the game now and then and I'd hope some of these issues are solved in patches and expansions.,Battlefleet Gothic: Armada 2,1,

This is the new version which has microtransactions and less mod support at this time but also has an upgraded engine that can give more stable gameplay with some setups. I personally prefer the original game and see no real advantage to upgrading even though I was given a copy of special edition free when it launched. If you own neither of them you should do your own research to see if you really need or want to put up with the creation club and it's associated inconveniences to the actual modding community that has sustained this game for the last 4 years prior to making any purchase decision.

PROS The game is now in 64 bit which MAY improve performance and stability (NOTE no this doesn't mean that your crappy HP Compaq with 2 GB of RAM will run the game in Ultra settings) As advertised the graphics have been remastered featuring updated textures and new cinematic lighting effects such as ""God Rays"".CONS Significantly less mods available on the Nexus though popular mods are slowly moving into the Special Edition Nexus a lot of mods have been left behind in the old repository. Creation Club. As of December 2017 the price tag slapped on the game is ridiculous. Not worth it if you didn't receive this game for free. CREATION. CLUB. Besides the remastered graphics and 64 bit engine Bethesda DID NOT fix any bugs from the old Skyrim.CONCLUSION If you haven't received this game for free don't buy it you'd just be tossing your money away. This is just Bethesda trying to tempt you and when you fall for it you get a nice kick in the nutsack. Performance wise it really varies depending on your system but here's my conclusion if you own an older rig stick with the old Skyrim the 64 bit system will not help you. Otherwise get Skyrim SE you should notice an increase in performance and stability compared to the old Skyrim if you own a newer rig.Personally I'd stick with the old Skyrim ESPECIALLY if you don't really own a good gaming rig or want to extensively mod your game.

I barely noticed at all any difference between vanilla skyrim original and vanilla Skyrim ""special edition"" For starters they could've made much better civilian / player models so they didn't look like poorly crafted dolls with cheap painted faces and hair like in the original many years before this new updated one. That would instantly bring this ""special edition"" to date and have it be special. If you're gonna update a game to the up to date times make it look it.

Pro's Better graphics Specificly blood water grass body and face textures look better than vanilla (its nothing compared to modded skyrim though) Better performance Its almost constantly at 60 fps only dropping between loading screens for a brief moment. No crashes lag freeze ups or major issues. Short loading screens I have experienced very short loading screens only times I get long loading screens is when I fast travel long distances and even then it is only 10 20 seconds. Fallout 4 save system Basicly we can make different characters and it automaticly switches saves makes it easy to make different characters without needing to worry about saves. Counts as a different game in your library from normal edition Basicly your saves mods and achievements and everything else is not shared between SE and normal edition so SE could be a clean slate if you have the old skyrim and broke it with too many mods. Cons Mods disable achievements Yeah Bethesda did it again. You can get a mod on the nexus to re enable them with mods but its worth mentioning. Not as many mods as skyrim This is the main downside to SE. For PC skyrim has far more mods than SE (but mod authors are working on making SE versions of their mods. Frostfall ordinator unofficial patches and others are already here and more are coming. People are having problems with the game. There are people that experience slow fps long loading screens frequent crashes and other issues. I have not had those issues but it is worth mentioning. So should you buy SE or regular? Do you have original skyrim for PC? Maybe not.Do you not have original skyrim or you're on console and you want the mods that SE will give you? YES go buy it. It is a great game especially with mods and mod authors are converting more and more mods from the old to the new.

6159,"2017-12-26",205,587,528,0,1,I am a grandmother who loves the Elder Schrolls games. I got started with Morrowind on my teenage Son's XBox over 16 years ago. So he bought me an XBox and game of my own. LOL When he moved over to PC for games so did I. I played Oblivion also. Loved it. Then when Skyrim came out on Steam he was sweet enough to purchase that for me too. The game is awesome in my opinion and I love the way the Special Edition looks. The graphics I believe. Looking forward to the next edition of Elder Scrolls.,The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition,1,
6160,"2016-12-20",12,439,475,0,1,"Game was and still is so cool but what's more remarkable to me is how easy is to look for/install/use the mods this time.I usually play the standard mode sometimes due to my laziness but this game has quite a few excellent mods especially if you are looking for a nice immersion and realism a couple of things that you couldn't find at the original skyrim. This mixed with the new graphics from the special edition makes it SO enjoyable even when you role play warming up for 5 minutes next to a fire pit.Mods i use Unofficial Skyrim Special Edition this fixes most of the bugs of the game Campfire Lets you build a campfire and different sorts of tents Vivid weathers Over 500+ Weathers with different sounds and adjustable brightness shadows etc. Frostfall Depending on how difficult you want it you can even freeze to death and rain makes you be wet and get colder faster Wet and Cold Same thing but mostly for NPCs. Also includes some other features like blurry screen when you look up while it's rainning or snowing. Point the way Since i'm looking for some realism i avoid fast travelling this is why i got this mod which shows me the way to every city at every crossroad. Lampposts of Skrim Lamp posts on the main roads but just what is necessary not plenty of them. Waves Now beaches with waves D Better horses Now horses go faster than you by foot something that makes kind of sense. Less agressive animals Just makes less agressive small animals like rats or crabs. Was kind of ridiculous to see a crab trying to fight imperial soldiers. Hunter's Reward Better prices Able to skin and sell pelts for a reasonable price in case you wanna play as a hunter. iNeed To eat to drink and to Sleep is now necessary and rewardable. Holidays Skyrim has special days like our christmas and all that stuff Expanded Carriage Service Carriage service in places where you couldn't find them before like Morthal or Dawnstar. Rich merchants of Skyrim Merchants have more money to buy meaning that you don't need to walk around all skyrim to sell the stuff. (1000 septims was humiliating for a merchant TBH) Run for your lives When a dragon attacks people run off instead of trying to smack the dragon. When vampires attack Same with vampires The Paarthurnax Dilemma Lets you spare his life. Hold border banners Banners from different holds are placed on their borders pretty simple but cool enough for me. Immersive patrols SE Since there's a civil war going on it's weird not to see any battle along the way until you join one of the sides of the war. With this mod you can find these fights while you walk around. Make other kind of patrols available like the dawnguard. Practice Dummies You can use them to improve your skill till level 30 out of 100. That means that you don't need to deal with badass foes with the skill ""i barely know how to hold the sword"". Mammoth Pelts You can skin mammoths something that i still don't get why it wasn't allowed in the original game. Dog followers are Huskies Makes it cooler and makes sense too since Skyrim is the north. Whistle Lets you whistle to the horse to make him come over avoiding to search for the damn horse every time he flees from a battle. NPC's Run and Walk at your pace exactly what the mod says. Animal poverty Animals don't drop gold. Like they have a bank account or something... Immersive armors adds different kind of armors and shields. The more smithing perks you got the more armors will show up. (Showed in auxiliary armors) MamTuskPowderGrind You can grind mammoth tusk to make its powder an ingredient that was so hard to find and wasn't allowed (don't know why) to make it out from the normal tusks. Fantasy Soundtrack Project Replaces the original music OR adds its songs to the original music. Just necessary if after all these hundreds of hours you got tired of the original one. Enhaced blood textures MORE BLOOD! Skyland Landscape texture overhaul Static Mesh Improvement Mod Better textures for interiors. Skyrim better roads More and better textures for main roads. Verdant Better textures for grass. Blacksmith forge water fix se Makes the water from the blacksmith look real. Yeah... once you realize you need it. Realistic water two Improves A LOT water textures and effects. Open cities Skyrim No loading screen when you get into a city (this needs a patch to work with Ineed mod) Immersive Citizens their behaviour and dialogues are more real. (needs a patch to work with Open cities)BTW i got them in this order and all of them work properlySome of the mods are only available on nexusmods which leads me to my final advise Download the mod ""noble skyrim"". Improves SO MUCH the city textures and buildings. There's just one problem it has been ported to special edition but still remains on original skyrim from nexus http //www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/45807/? There are two options wait till it's completely ported to SSE or download it manually from original skyrim and install it manually from Nexus Mod Manager as well. It won't show up on the list but it will be there so don't worry. There's a patch as well to work properly with SMIM mod (Static Meshes).EDIT I strongly recommend another mod that i just found out! it's called Amazing Follower Tweaks SSE and i found it on nexusmods. Short description you can have more than 1 follower (which is nice since Campfire mod adds tents up to 4 people) and it's possible to tweak each follower as you wish like creating different sets of outfits depending on if they are outside or inside a city setting primary spells weapons THEY CAN EVEN RIDE HORSES NOW!! and some other stuff.

6178,"2018-07-27",0,0,4,0,1,Product received for free. okay. first of all allow me to get this out of the way. i hate what bethesda did with the creation club. they essentially made modding (somthing that was universally FREE through all of normal skyrim for the most part) into a way to make money after already having to pay 40 bucks for the base game (granted you recieved it for free if you had the original and all the DLC) just to have to go and buy credits that you and only buy in set amounts with the higest being the same price as the game itself. i feel like this was bethesda just being greedy with a fan favorite that everyone knew and loved. and while yes you can still go to nexus and mod bypassing bethesdas greed it still feels like a kick to the gut for those of us that played the game since it first came out on pc and console. now for the upsides. the game is beautiful. its a surefire upgrade from the original skyrim and is an amazing game to play. and while some will enjoy the original more (i do for the simple fact my pc is and can run the original skyrim better) just going through the beginning was enough for me to be awestruck as if i was playing skyrim all over again for the very first time. the gameplay is simply amazing and sucks you in. and while this brings me to my one personal downside SSE is still a 1 game for anyone.downside is that with the updated graphics and the amazing features this game is hard on any computer that isent up to date in its hardware and software. my computer even the lowest graphics settings could run it but not without the lighting glitching all to hell and textures ing up. maybe its because my install dident finish correctly(?) but i still love this game.,The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition,1,

6181,"2018-02-23",2,17,0,0,0,"Its a Bethesda game what did you expect. Looks and plays horribly Terrible engine where you can slide down walls avoiding all fall damage. Or where props and bodies constantly flip out which leads them to get shot straight into the stratosphere you climb the highest mountain by repeatedly pressing space etc. Boring repetitive quests that force you to join guilds or serve daedric lords even if you wish to play as a good guy Big and empty (recycled NPCs empty buildings everybody looks exactly the same extremely unappealing environments) Full of bugs and glitches that haven't been addressed YEARS after launch (with devs calling them ""charming features"") Released the same game 5 times for a quick buck with zero improvementsMods are the only thing keeping this garbage alive. And Bethesda should thank their lucky stars that people didn't give up on this parody of a parody of a game.Skyrim would have been dead on arrival if not for the modders' hard work and dedication. Over the years the modders have fixed the graphics sound engine added real physics HD textures made the world rich and beautiful interesting to live in and pleasant to look at. Improved and polished pretty much every aspect of the game. I have 90GBs of mods that I have to install every time I want to film stuff in game. Hey have you ever heard of Skyrim ? Oh the cockroach meme yeah!People call Skyrim a cockroach because it just won't die. Just when it seems that people are starting to forget about it Beth simply re realease Skyrim a couple more times Original Anthology Edition Legendary Edition Special Edition Switch Edition VR Edition all of them being the same exact game. No bug fixes same glitches same texture flickering and no improvements or any real effort put into it.Bethesda became a meme a laughing stock for any real developers out there who put love and effort into their games. Who actually test their games and play them themselves before releasing. Hell look at some of the games in Early Access on Steam. Those developers fix and patch bugs hours after they've been reported. But a massive tripple a behemoth like Bethesda ? Why bother ? Just re release the same game 5 years later. And of course everyone will buy it because they were foolish enough to think that Beth would have fixed all the bugs and glitches by then. They surely must have fixed Skyrim by now and probably gave it that awesome fantasy look right ?Nope! Skyrim Special Edition is a joke.They spent 5 years on ""improving"" and re releasing the same hot garbage. With their only real improvement being that the game is now ""more stable"". When it should have been stable right from the start like all the normal games are.The modders for the original Skyrim came up with much much better mods and fixes A WEEK after the game was released. A week! And that's people who do this leisurely for fun or out of the kindness of their souls. Original Skyrim with just one mod is ten times better than the unmodded Special Edition edition of the game. Which took them 5 years to ""remaster"".This sentence alone should help you realize what kind of company you're about to give your money to.Absolutely terrible. And Skyrim serves no other purpose than to be modded into a real game.That is the only reason it is still alive.Oh and Bethesda wants people to pay for mods made by other people to improve their game.

If you're on the fence I would wait a while. It amazes me that a team of modders created an ""Unofficial Patch"" that fixed most of Skyrim's problems but Bethesda didn't bother to fix the problems before releasing this ""Special Edition."" To be fair the lighting improvements are nice. Depth of Field and ""god rays""are now options. 64 bit allows for better framerates. Unfortunately we still have to dig around in the config files to adjust the field of view (FOV). One of Bethesda's unexpected new ""features"" is you can no longer get achievements if you use mods. Why would they do that? This can be bypassed with a mod but every time Skyrim releases a patch you have to wait for the mod to update. Speaking of mods some have been updated to this new version but mods that rely on SKSE's scripting functions will need to wait until it is updated.I do not recommend purchasing the Special Edition of Skyrim right now. If you got it for free great! A 64 bit executable and improved lighting is nice but it doesn't justify a $60 price tag.

New graphics look a bit better but it's not worth it to have more physics bugs. I dislike the new mod system and wish they continued with the steam workshop. I cant complain too much since I recieved the game for free however there is no way I would suggest paying retail for this version. They also added a super cool feature where once the bethesda feature appears the game crashes. Doing a full reinstallation process doesn't fix this.

However it should be noted that you may still experience poor performance in Oldrim depending on your Processor. Oldrim was designed and optimized for dual core processors and while there are some ini tweaks to make it somewhat better they don't actually do much. Basically the less powerful the first two cores of your processor are (such as with the i7 4790k which is what I have which sacrificed performance in the first two cores to have four equally functional cores) the more oldrim will chug at times particularly in areas densely packed with NPCs like Whiterun (top of the stairs there kills my framerate.)Skyrim SE does not have this problem as the updated version of the Creation Engine that it runs on is optimized for quad cores and beyond. This is the primary reason SE runs so much better on more recent systems.Still the MAIN reason to switch to SE is now obsolete. If you don't mind framerate drops in certain areas Oldrim just offers substantially more mod content...and you don't even have to get prodded with the creation club to experience it! Only go for SE if you really really prefer the smoother experience over the excess content...I mean to be fair it isn't like Skyrim vanilla isn't already loaded to the bloody brim with content and the amount of mods ported over grows by the day. In the time since I originally wrote this review SKSE64 has gone into a beta state and a lot of the ""essential"" mods for a good skyrim playthrough are slowly but surely becoming available to those who want the SE stability. ORIGINAL REVIEW I'm going to put this review up as a means to inform on a certain value belonging to this version of the game and not the t Creation Club nonsense. I do not support that idiotic service in any way shape or form but if you are one of the two people left in the first world who has not played Skyrim or you are using a newer built PC there's an element to the special edition you may want to consider.I recieved Skyrim Special Edition for free as did any previous owners of the original game + all of the DLC.For those who don't know Windows 8 and Windows 10 have a critical flaw in regards to Direct X9 which prevent them from utilizing more than a total 4gb of VRAM regardless of how much you actually have available for use. Guess what the original Skyrim was built atop?In otherwords unless you're still using Windows 7 odds are attempting to mod your classical Skyrim is going to be significantly more limiting than you may expect. 4GB of VRAM is just not a lot to go with when many of the most prominant visual mods expecially things like texture mods use very high resolution assets and that 4GB will be stretched extreme thin very very fast. Unfortunately the problem with DX9 is hardcoded into the newer varients of Windows itself and despite many the pleas from the community Microsoft seems more than happy to completely ignore it and leave it in place. In otherwords there is no way to remove the limiter and as such no way to get around the fact that some older games like Skyrim or DoW1 which run on DX9 will run objectively worse on NEWER computers than they would on older ones.The only real benefits to SE over the original Skyrim are because of this. SE has been completely converted over into DX11 and as a result the limiters do not apply. On top of that the game just runs flat out better and for what it is worth SE's graphical improvements over Vanilla are very noticable and quite well done. If you're the kind of person who likes visual mods but don't go deep into the side of things like ENBs the vanilla world visuals of SE may be more than enough for your tastes. On top of this SE is also notably more stable than the original which is to be expected.Unfortunately this comes with the caveat that many mods have not been properly ported into SE yet and also many mods flat out will not function with SE until SKSE64 the SKSE version being created for SE is complete.So pick your poison. You can get the original and be forced to severely limit your modding capabilities due to an obnoxious forced Vram limit coutesy of Microsoft or you can get the SE and not have to deal with such problems but have severely limited mod choices until an undisclosed period in the future where SKSE64 becomes available to the public.The point of this post is to inform people that yes there is indeed a logical reason for SE to exist. Unless Microsoft pulls their heads out of thier asses and removes the hard cap on DX9 the more time passes and the further away from 2011 we get the more and more unrealistic it is going to be to play a properly modded vanilla Skyrim.But if you DO choose to go with the CE I would advise two things Vote with your wallet go NOWHERE NEAR the Creation Club and it's disgusting practices. Do not even spend the free 100 points they give you to try it out. Tell Bethesda to sod off with their ""mini DLC totally not paid mods"" nonsense.And The Creation Club currently forces you to download 2GB worth of data essentially all of the mods that are currently available on it. If you do not buy literally every single mod on the platform that 2GB is dead weight on your hard drive and unless Bethesda swallows their pride and axes the service for the failure that it is that number is only going to go up. Fortunately there is a certain mod on a certain prominant modding site which will replace all of the files forcefully downloaded by the Creation Club with negligable alternatives saving you precious space. I'd advise wholeheartedly that you consider picking it up.",The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition,1,

6190,"2016-10-29",0,0,161,0,1,Product received for free. The new Skyrim Special Edition is a pretty clear difference between the original vanilla version of Skyrim. Mostly with how smoothly the game runs.Compared to the older version of Skyrim this now loads ultra fast. Running in 64 bit also gives the game much more stability.My break down for this is Pros Some improved graphics and tweaks to the environment. 64 bit (the BEST reason) Faster loading times and better stability. A future potential for better mods to be released. Free for PC users who had owned the entire set.Cons I personally think the improved graphics isn't really all that great but it's mostly because I have played the game with some nice HD mods and ENB enabled which makes this pale in comparison. To a vanilla player though this is a lot nicer. I just kind of feel like they could have done better... Especially with the character textures. No improved UI. This is perhaps the biggest con. The Mod Load order system within the game is quite clunky and has caused problems for me once.To anyone marking down this game because certain mods aren't released yet Um. You do realize that mods are made independently and not by Bethesda? Have some patience. P The SKSE team has released a statement saying that it will take a long time to release the new SE version. I've already seen some uploaders on the Nexus releasing a dull version of SkyUI so even if the author is MIA I'm sure someone will remake it when SKSE is released.For now there are a lot of mods up on the Nexus that you can use. Try them out if you'd like or wait until SKSE/SkyUI is released and enjoy replaying the vanilla. Cheers.,The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition,1,

Big Skyrim fan since it came out but nonetheless nothing changed with the Special edition.To counter some of the so called positives in the game Graphics Graphics are better than vanilla but not in the slightest worth the 60 bucks they charge for it.

Optimization/Performance Let me start by giving you my specs gtx 1080 Oc'ed i5 4690k OC'ed 16gb ddr3 ram 144hz monitor (2560x1440). My main problem with the vanilla version is that (understandably) any refresh rate above 60hz wasn't supported (again understandable given at that time there wasn't much above 60hz). Now once I started up the SE it was still buggy like crazy not talking about water flickering buggy but talking about horse going batshit crazy buggy. Patches came out saying they made optimization fixes for the 144hz display which in my opinion didn't change anything. For some kind of reason I can't even play past 60fps anymore (Yes I disabled Vsync yes I changed the right Ini files yes I altered the nvidia cp yes I did everything I could think of and no I'm not new to this) conclusion still runs like crap (not so much like unplayable but more like the same crap the vanilla skyrim played at.) Sounds You all know the whole audio fiasco surrounding Skyrim SE I'm not even going any further into it. Patches/fixes Takes them months to come out with patches when they do come out they'll be vague like we are used to from Bethesda games. and won't really change the more important bugs or problems.Verdict Is it a fun game? Yes it's skyrim for me it was one of the best games there was until recently. Is it worth it's money today ? Not at all It is the same game as the one released in 2011. This is a blatant money grab not spending any time on the game but still raking in the cash. Keep in mind that this is coming from a huge Skyrim fan. I always wished that Bethesda wouldn't turn into what is becoming a trend among developpers but only time could prove that I was wrong If you can buy the vanilla version mod you game to the max and enjoy a truly special experience but don't encourage this kind of behavior from developpers.,The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition,1,

There have been bugs there have been crashes but NOTHING that renders the game completely unplayable. Skyrim SE has finally broken that. This game is nothing short of useless. I can launch the game I can get anywhere between 5 and 15 minutes into it before it crashes and my computer reboots. Nothing I have attempted thus far has had any effect on fixing the game. If I paid money for this I would be furious. Lucky for me I got it free on release because I owned Skyrim Ledgendary Edition. From what I see in the first 15 minutes SE looks and plays no different then th first release. Any improvements could easily be attained or even surpassed by modding the original release.

6228,"2016-11-01",1,3,18,0,1,"I hardly ran into any game breaking bugs back in the orignal skyrim with only one main quest bug occurring and another causing me unable to craft Stalhrim equipment. Other than that I faced very few issues and now that Special Edition has een released I am glad to say that I have yet to run into any problems with the new release. Colors look far more crisp with the extra additions being nice welcomes without the need of mods now. Some of these include rain not clipping through building structures to the addition of God Rays and improved textures. Weather effects have also been enchanced for a more visual appealing look as well. There are a couple of additional graphical tweaks that users can change as well such as depth of field. The new engine is now 64 bit and as a result is not subject to memory limitations faced by 32 bit. As a result my loads times are far more quicker with some being almost instantaneous. Since I received my copy for free due to the the upgrade promotion I find this to be a rather generous move by the company and one that broadens my hopes by what future mods can accomplish with the new engine. I never ecpected an updated version of skyrim as it was releeased not too long ago but this new updated released has me reliving the fun I had years ago. I never expected this to be a ""remaster"" in the sense of completely new assets because for the most part it was not needed. It is true that bugs have not been fixed from the previous 32 bit release but I have yet to encounter these throughout my playtime. If you own the older version and have nothing to gain from this updated version then it is not for you but if you do want some slightly updated visuals along with better performance then this is the definitive version to buy. Another possible flaw is that the audio has been compressed now however Bethesda has stated they are working to improve the audio once again on the pc version and mods also exist to put back the orignal uncompressed audio. If you are looking for a reason to go back to Skyrim or never got the chance to experience why Skyrim had one of the biggest modding communities or memes for a period of time then I highly sugest getting this game.",The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition,1,

So free game is free and I like free. But after downloading it and setting up my graphic settings. I was curious on to mods. I was sadden when I saw that the steam community didn't have mods for the Special Edition. And Then things went downhill after that. I saw they had Bethesda.net and wanted you to log into there. So naturally I go to the site and try to create an account since I don't have one. Well it asked for a fairly simple request with usernames. But every username that is fairly unique to me was some how ""unavailable"" aka taken. I spent a solid 30 minutes trying to come up with any username before i just gave up on that notion. I seriously would say that if you are going to get this game for the modding community don't bother.

Pros + Has better textures + They 've corrected previous game mechanic issues like saving a game. What i mean is that in the vanilla version for expample when you ended the game you had lets say 5.000 saves and when you begun a new one you had like 5.001. in Special Edition when you end the game and you have 5.000 saves now when you begin a new game you have actually 0 saves. + They've added the Mod option in the game menu which is very comfortable compared to Vanilla one. + SE now supports 64 bit which means it is in theory capable of loading so much more into memory and in turn that should mean far more epic modsCons The sound quality has been seriously downgraded Vanilla Skyrim has tons of mods compared to SE meaning more choicesNevertheless i do recommend the game.

They want to try to build hype and make everyone dream of a new Elder Scrolls game.Well I'm still dreaming. This game looks much the same as the PC version I had before. I had a few mods (water updates fire textures yeah those bright glowing logs and some add ons) but nothing that greatly changed the visuals. They could at least have added some new content a quest series a new guild ride around in wagons ANYTHING. Now I have to go find new mods for everything (inventory window skills/leveling).I'm quite disappointed in the release. Maybe I'll go back and play ME2 &amp ME 3 at least they have a new game releasing soon . . .,The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition,1,

I can't really complain since I got the Special Edition for free due to owning all the DLC for the original game but if I payed money for this hoping to get a modern looking game I would be very disappointed. They updated the ugly vanilla game from something muddy and low res to something slightly less muddy with a bit higher pixel count in their textures. Definitely still looks like a game that came out years ago. Beyond that I only just got to the character creation screen before I ran into a glitching guard that kept disappearing and reappearing every time he tried to walk through his horse while he was talking to me. So those bugs still exist too. Shadows are still overly dark and ruddy colors are still muted and nearly mono chrome. All around disappointing.Long story short the Special Edition is definitely not worth the $40 price tag. Go buy the GOTY edition of the original game if you really want to get into the series or at least wait until they drop the price on this.,The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition,1,

The game simply doesnt recognize the latter and keeps running on the lowest possible settings. Settings the performance card as default and forcing the game to run on it as opposed to the low performance does not change anything.

As someone who is an achievement hunter and to some extent wasting time on an open world Bethesda game despite my personal problems with it I still don't recommend to just about anyone from buying this game in the future.Because you'd be better off buying the legendary edition than the special edition (referred to as ""SE"" for my following review).Sure the SE's graphics are noted to be slightly better than vanilla Skyrim but only slightly.What's more is that the lightning effects are pretty much the only thing notable to be improved while say the graphics of NPCs indoor items they are all still the same with the only difference being done because of the lightning.This is not how you do remastered art.This is how you just plainly release the same product again with the same janky NPC animations that pretty much most if not all of them share the same voice actors only in a slightly more pretty looking sky.Gameplay wise it's the same open world rpg game though I admit that after playing the Witcher 3 it really feels awkward to return to a game like Skyrim and feeling less like I roleplay anything specific and more of the usual time when I just do whatever I want no reprecussions and just get all the loot and fortune.But the real problem with the SE the reason why I am not recommending this is because the game is awefully buggy. Honestly I'm tired of Bethesda getting away with bug ridden games because people think it's funny.Sure it is sometimes but then again some of these bugs do end up crashing the game or just make a quest plain unplayable because you were too curious to explore an area before the proper quest forcing you to figure out how to use whirlwind sprint shout while holding a wooden plate in the air just to clip through the castle's gates. Or in another case when you plain can't stop an NPC's aggro DESPITE HIM BEING ESSENTIAL AND IMMORTAL IN THE QUEST and end up just noclipping in an order to finish said quest!This is pretty much why I hate to see people still praising skyrim for what it does not deserve as this special edition is nothing more than a cash grab at a game that I mostly play now just so I can clear the achievements again and nothing else.

( Is that a sweetroll in your pocket * heavy breathing*)The godrays and effects are almost straight taken from fallout 4 ( a game that was developed along side of skyrim but who doesnt know fallout 4 eh?) It emulates an ENB without actually having the effect of an enb. ( imagine back to the distance past when an unstable version of DirectX was released between 9 and 11. We speak not its name. thats what its like.)Colors are overbright or washed out.( HueHueHue)Any glow effects highlight the low res/ outdated textures.( If you draw a on a piece of paper and then go over it with a highlighter same effect)Your mods? not supported. maybe the mod makers will feel like wasting thier time to update thier mods to support this iteration maybe not.Same old bugs some new no fixes.If i were to re release a game for the third time i would have fixed some bugs finished the ing civil war content/story added some small DLC/updated the old DLC and released 2k textures that everyone has been asking for for 3 years.I would have paid 15$ for that.

Game is poorly optimized and lag is persistent on every graphic quality even on a beast machine like mine which can run other games just fine around 50 60 fps. Graphics are not that better just some textures were changed to make characters more ""characters"". Game occlusion and ENB are ridiculous two vertical bars constantly on screen show a damaged/broken graphic setting somewhere Enhancements are minimal rocks or plants here and there minimal weather fixes and such. Basically looks like they have installed public mods on the Special Edition. Really? Public mods won't be supported anymore that is to say if you play with material from the Nexus you won't be able to save your game. But apparently Bethesda is working on a Mod System similar to Fallout 4. Game crashes here and there or just gets stuck on the main menu forcing a shut down. No real stuff was added it's like they had to make some fast cash by selling an old product with a better repaint. Good thing they gave it to me for free.I am a HUGE fan of this series and Bethesda in general but this was really a kick in my face.So thanks but no thanks I will stick to the regular Legendary edition I already had for years.If you have it already don't spend a single copper on this ""Special Edition"" game at least until they will fix the mess they have done already.",The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition,1,

Now 20% more subtle and 300% more aggressively forced!After adding payed mods to the workshop some time ago and miserably failing because of angry customers the workshop was completely removed now for the special edition and the original game (with workshop support) hidden from the store. Instead you now pay for mods or manage everything manually outside of steam using nexus mods etc. Mod compatibility was broken of course so you rather go for the paid ones.Keeping a game alive and interesting with mod support and an active community is no longer wanted. That may be good to make a name for your company but once you have it you have to milk money. You're not supposed to play a game released 6 years ago unless you start paying again! You're hurting the whole industry with that anti capitalist behavior! It's like playing with the same box of lego bricks for years how do you make a profit from that?!And why some more money out of an old title with creative scamming models?

6342,"2016-11-24",0,0,119,0,1,This game is the same as the Original no fixes or aditional quests. A little frustrating that the bugs didnt get fixed that have been glaring since 2011 including the internal timings being linked directly to FPS and refresh rate of monitor and as was mostly expected any modded save games will end up being incompatible from the original over to the SE version.. BUT that said It is an improvment over the original.. graphics aside for most people (myself included) this game will be more stable for you after then engine switch to 64 bit. I find the Graphics aditions to be noticable and enjoyable to have default with no modding needed to look breathtaking and modding it now only improves it further. The modding community isnt QUITE as dedicated to Skyrim SE or at least seems that way with a very slow process or no process in switching mods from original 32 bit skyrim to 64 bit skryimSE ... so unfortunately some of the bigger mods you may have used may not be available .. YET .. most major ones have been switched over and or are in the process of being converted. the primary holdup being the lack of the SKSE 64 bit being done (which is actively being worked on as I type this). Is it esential to make the switch to S? Maybe maybe not.. not yet.. but it shows immense promise. The base game itself will always be great and the modded content will only improve as time goes on to eventually bring it into the standard we were all used to in the Vanilla Skyrim. In time the mods will likely even be bigger and better for SE than the Vanilla one. TLDR It's not a Nirn shattering change from the original however there are enough things to make it worth the upgrade and in time I feel it /will/ have a better platform to work with than the original.

Walked away from it years passed memories faded the dead slumbered...Picked up a Vive recently and I was interested to note that Skyrim was listed under the supported games for Vorpx a driver that makes games playable in VR. I hadn't played Skyrim in awhile it might be a fresh experience I thought.Reinstalled Skyrim to check it out after installing a few choice mods for SE fired up the Vive loaded the Vorpx started Skyrim and... there's several very poignant VR experiences out there like theBlu Batman VR Experience Vanishing Realms games made specifically for VR that give you that sense of ""being there"" Skyrim SE with the Vorpx Driver might as well be one of those games. When you combine these things you stop merely ""playing"" Skyrim and you start ""Experiencing"" it. I feel at one with every rock every reed of every plant every texture of every surface in the game I feel like I can reach out and touch Lydia's face as if she's stading before me ever ready to carry my burdens I feel like I'm standing in the Dragon's flame in the North's cold embrace somewhere on the rooftop of the world miles away from where I am who I am what I am. I look around me now and all I see is Skyrim from its bubbling brooks to its roaring rapids from it's grassy foothills to its frozen mountains the weather on my face the sunshine at my back my enemies driven before me the lamentations of the women all the best things in this... new life.One day you will find my dried and withered husk VR headset strapped to me face I will have assimilated myself into the system and my birth cry will be the ringing of every telephone on earth and any mortal brave enough to acccept the call will hear my Thu'um ""Slen Tiid Vo!

All skyrim scenery transforms into one smooth and beatiful world and though there are poor textures here and there especially on NPC's faces and hands overall experience is one huge step ahead... simply wondering around returned me 5 years back in time to the same shocking emotion of immersive alive open world which became solid and refined in terms of visuals again.10/10 I highly recommend game as it is now and no amount of bugs or poor textures can spoil that wonderful feeling you got from playing elder scrolls in new light.I am rather sceptical and whiny gamer but here.. it is simply amazing and I guess with proper adaption of mods this game will live more 5 years as an reference game for RPG genre.",The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition,1,

I myself played around 430 hours of always 100+ mods and it was amazing i loved the game skyrim base and with mods the entire experience kicks off but any modded player will tell you skyrim just isnt as good without mods the graphics cant compare some followers e.g. Sofia are far superior and much more. And i completely agree I would never play skyrim vanilla vs skyrim modded if i had the choice. and its just the vanilla vs modded experience is heavily one sided on the mod side so theres no point instantly upgrading unless you yourself are a modder and want to use the new engine to create mods.but what i mean by yes is in about 2 3 months if enbs are supported and the modders of skyrim port their mods into the new game as many are already itll be faaaaaaaaar better because of bethesda fixing some bugs and the new 64bit engine and the scripts (although when it comes out you should 100% swap to skse se because its far far far superior and many mods require it e.g skyui) so when everything gets updated and ported it should be a far superior experience compared to 2011 skyrim.overall i most likely wont be playing the game for a while at least until skse or skyui somehow is supported for the new game. But when those mods are ported and availible for the game? ill be playing like its 2011 again im really excited for the remastered mods but a remaster of the actual game? didnt need it it wouldve been nicer to see a full new fresh remaster of oblivion or morrowind instead. so in conclusion theres no point instantly upgrading unless you yourself are a modder and want to use the new engine to create mods. However if you just want to play the game without mods go ahead and play its just a better skyrim for you but if you want mods youre gonna have to wait until skse se releases but when it does ill be playing it for sure alongside of many other people,The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition,1,

6386,"2016-10-27",0,0,155,0,1,Product received for free. I would take most of the performance related reviews with a grain of salt. The framerate for me on ultra settings isnt perfect (40fps but with below 1 pc requirements) but this is to be expected considering the improved graphics ive also yet to experience a single crash. Now as far as the actual improvments go its a signifcant improvment upon the OG skyrim. Lastly the mods while i personally dont use many (especially with the special edition) the utter rage people have regarding mods on the special edition is idiotic. While yes some mods just wont work and others will need to be updated what were people expecting everything to just work all hunky dory? its a new engine for christs sake. If you dont like it play the OG skyrim with the mods that apprently make it look/run better anyway no ones forcing you to buy this. Anyways mods on the special edition should be bigger and better than before thanks to the special edition being 64 bit.So should you buy it? I would but it thats my opinion look at what the game offers and decide if you can justify spending the gold (and if your pc can handle it of course).,The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition,1,

The shackles have been finally dropped from the modding community and being a slave to the 4gb of ram limitation Skyrim has contended with.Plus receiving this for free was a nice gesture on Bethesda's part.Graphics out of the box is a moderate improvement in some areas and not so much in others... but in my humble opinion not the main selling point for us PC gamers who love to run MODs.All in all no complaints.,The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition,1,

The 64bit upgrade gives us a lot more options where modding is concerned and greater stability.Don't really get the negative reviews as some are saying that it was the same game as before which is what bethesda said it would be with some upgrades in certain areas i.e(lighting water shders etc) . This remaster wasn't supposed to be huge for pc it was meant to be big for the consoles. Which having played skyrim on the console I can see how the improvements listed would be huge for console players.Edit. After having played the game for a few more hours I figured I would give my review a little update.The stability in this game is amazing. I remember having a few texture enhancements and getting open cities of skyrim and going into Whiterun just to see my frames tank as soon as the gates opened (same rig with no upgrades between games) now I can open the gates and my frames dont change from 60. Also many of the texture mods from Skyrim work and more are being added to the nexus and bethesda.net constantly. So I still say that the upgrade in the engine was well worth it.Helpful tip run the game in fullscreen borderless it really seems to help performance wise.To those who were wanting to know.I7 4790k980tiGame on HDD144hz Monitor Locked at 6016gigs of Ram,The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition,1,
6393,"2016-10-28",0,0,305,0,1,Played enough to see that it is just Skyrim with updated graphics. Which is perfectly fine. Now that the game is 64 bit expect much better mod support/ports of mods once SKSE gets updated.Impactful changes Borderless windowed works really well. I can alt tab easily even during loading screens and don't have any cursor glitches in the few times I tried it.Audio quality is a lot worse as they've decided to change the .wav files into .xwm with quite a bit of compression. I'm sure there will be a mod to fix this in the future as it just requires replacing audio files with .wavs or better quality .xwms.If you don't have this for free wait for substantial mod support before buying unless you know you're okay with Vanilla Skyrim.,The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition,1,

This is a GOOD THING. If you didn't already own the DLC for the original game which all came out within the first year and a half of a now 5 year old game and you didn't get the free upgrade the only person to blame is yourself. Clearly you didn't enjoy it enough to buy the extended content for it so why should you get that content for free now? This version of the game very quickly replaced my love for vanilla Skyrim with higher frame rates higher default color contrast and 64 bit processing. The trees are actually green now! I love it!For the best mods head over to the Nexus Mods website (just Google it). If you install all your mods manually and have compatibility issues or it kills your game you'll likely have to start from scratch and re install everything. Save yourself the headache and stick with the in game mod downloads (easy) or the Nexus Mod Manager (more control can install mods not on Bethesda's list).

At this time the game still has many of the bugs that Skyrim originally launched with like some collisions issues with items ""exploding"" upon entering an area and being sent in every direction possible and clipping through doors when entering. Now these for the most part don't ruin the game really at all but the only thing that remains broken in both versions of the game now is Dragonborn. It is still an absolute mess and requires the use of the console just to fix the quests and advance. Now with these grievances aside the game does look quite nice the graphical upgrade is noticeable compared to the vanilla and the lighting effects do make a large difference especially in the southern forests of Falkreath at night. If you did not recieve it for free for owning the collection I would still say it's worth it just because it is still Skyrim but yes overall it is a small upgrade for the price. 8/10.",The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition,1,

I dunno.Now I will give credit where credit is due There were some parts as I explored from an old savegame that DID look different. The character models are noticeably smoother. The fire looks cooler. There's a couple nice lighting effects.But by and large it looks the same as the Ordinary Edition.Downsides I noticed a lot of rings running through everything as I ran around which was not particularly immersive. As I ran through the wilderness in some places I noted that the extra grass shrubs little rocks etc. didn't appear until I got close to them and from a distance everything was flat unlike Ordinary Edition without mods. This was also not particularly immersive. Everything seemed to take a long time to load. Overall performance seemed notably worse even on rather low graphics settings at least when I was in outdoor areas there was a fair amount of general slowness and lag.May or may not be downsides First person view is a bit closer to the ground I think and everything is definitely ""zoomed in"" close up things are REALLY close and you can't see as much of your hands/weapons. This might be confusing to longtime players of the original. Also apparently you now need to have an account with Bethesda in order to use mods. And the main menu doesn't have a link to the options menu which is just dumb IMO but that's a minor point.In summary Updated graphics in some areas that are not that special is the only upside that I noticed. Performance was worse than vanilla Ordinary Edition and I'd say slightly worse than heavily modded Ordinary Edition as well though that varies depending on how much save bloat you have. I did not pay anything for this game and I'm glad I didn't. If you already have Skyrim don't waste your money on this. If you don't well both are about the same price so pick whichever you want.

6450,"2017-04-22",0,0,404,0,1,Product received for free. I spent over 1 000 hours playing the original on Steam and thousands more hours on Xbox 360. It was my first Elder Scrolls game and after playing all of them from Arena to Oblivion it's still my favorite and the one game I always come back to after I tire of others.The Special Edition does not dissapoint either. It seems a bit underwhelming to some veteran players because the most noticible new feature the improved graphics have been available through mods for a long time. What I think is much more important is the improved stability. After 20 30 hours into a game the original Skyrim would start suffering all sorts of weird glitches and crashes and mods would often bring that on much sooner. Then there was the constant crashing from running out of RAM an other limitations of the original 32 bit build.Special Edition fixes this and while I'm still waiting for my favorite mods to update a lot of really great content has already been updated or made newly for the Special Edition.Disclaimer I did receive this game for free because I already owned Legendary Edition. If it had not been free I probably would be more critical of the lack of new content and the new mechanism that disables acheivements if you're using mods.,The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition,1,

Not much of a difference tbh and having this game compared to the older game doesn't really make a difference to PC players because we could probably make the original look better than this with mods. I just think remastering it was a good business decision for Bethesda because of the current generation console players (PS4 + XBONE). Allowing them to play such a good game is a great decision and it could also entice those who had Skyrim on last gen who have then upgraded to buy it again and play it. If you're on PC and you didn't get it for free like most did I wouldn't buy it.,The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition,1,
6463,"2016-10-28",0,0,437,0,1,"Heya All I am very happy for this update. I have played with Vanilla Skyrim SE and like what I see so far. However I am tabling it for now until some mods I like get converted. I beat skyrim on an un modded playthru during origional release. So I got that feel already. These days I prefer the modded experiance for some aspects of my play thru.SE Pros Updated Base World Graphics Asthetics and ENB (lighting). Seems to be nicer and more true to Bethesda fantasy but with better graphics. So possibly may not need as many visual mods. Played for a short while looked at many world textures and I personally am happy. Engine Converted to 64 Bit allowing game and some mods to function better on current PCs. This paves the way for potentially new mods that can do much more than before. Thats up to the creativeness of the community though.SE Cons ""Unofficial Skyrim Patch"" was not integrated into the base game to my knowledge. I do not know if Bethesda performed any offical bug fixes to the base game or not. But my hunch is we will still need the ""Unofficial Skyrim Patch"" to fix alot of things in the world. Some players have tried the patch on Skyrim SE but it seems to cause problems. So we need to wait for the mod to be updated to work better with Skyrim SE. Old textures on Armors weapons equipment house hold objects dungeon objects and thousands of other items don't look updated to me. Looking forward to the Static Mesh improvement mod HD weapon/Armor mods to be converted to Skyrim SE. Not looking for non skyrim items/equipment meshes. Just would like higher quality meshes for existing skyrim equipment. Kinda the bridge between lore friendly and better looking. Not older PC friendly. If you ran Skyrim on High/Ultra 5 6 years ago you might be at low/Medium settings today with Skyrim SE. If you've updated your computer since then like I did. You might still be at High/Ultra. No NPC or Character mesh/skin updates. Still have origional character looks/feels. Will need modding to touch up some people. Waiting for CBBE to be converted... Don't judge me... &gt .&gt Many older Mods may never work again unless the Mod Author comes back to update it or another mod author takes over the project and tries to update it.Other Notes PC Performance. Some users are reporting sinificant performance issues with their computers. When they list their system specs and I compare it to mine sometimes we're fairly similar. Yet I am not noticing any visual or perfomance issues. My rig is a Win 10 PRO i7 6700k 32GB ram GeForce GTX 970 and Samsung Evo 850 SSDs. Some users are reporting Bugs with the starting scene on the cart. No mods yet the cart still flips the fraq out or the Horses get in the way during the execution scene. Hopefully a bugfix will come for that soon. Mod Development will take time folks. Its up to you to decide if you want to play a limited mod experiance or wait for a while. thank you all and I hope you enjoy the updates and updated mods. Good luck Mod Makers.

No one is making you play this and if it's bothering you so much steam has a feature where they can remove certain games from your library. This wasnt meant to add content i do agree that it could of fixed some of the bugs but I'm happy they didn't. It just makes the game a tad bit more nostalgic. Did they have to do it? No they didn't. And the port to the new engine just makes it more beautiful and immersive. Take it as you will. It's literally the SAME game with the SAME content as The Elder Scrolls V Skyrim released in 2011. It just looks better and that is what they were marketing about it. Personally I really like that Bethesda did this and I honestly hope they do this with Morrowind and maybe even Oblivion.And before I forget YOU GOT THIS FOR FREE YOU IDIOTS SO SHUT UP. They could of said ""Umm so yeah we are gonna release Skyrim again but with a different engine and it will look nicer. And you know what?

6480,"2016-10-30",0,0,153,0,1,Product received for free. Seeing so many people spitting venom at this special edition I'm a little dumbfounded.Why do they hate it so much Mods are now incompatible Bugs are still there Saves incompatibility because of mods Bethesda wants moneyWell first of all that's true mods played a hell of a lot in the popularity of Skyrim. They're awesome and indispensable. Without them Skyrim would never be the same. And now they're all broken in this special edition.But they're currently being modified to be compatible it's only been launched 3 days ago and a lot of those awesome mods are already available... So we can expect before long if not all but at least a big majority of the most popular ones to arrive on this version.Then Skyrim was always bugged as hell and this version is not an exception from what people say. However we can expect updates and bug fixes. On this point I have yet to play it enough to talk more about it.Another point was that saves which use mods might be incompatible and that's a shame. But on another hand you can't really expect anyone to give you a warranty on something completely different from what they provided you. And about Bethesda wanting more money. Well as most people on PC we received it for FREE because we loved the game and that's why we bought the 3 DLCs (even though I don't really consider Heartfire as a real DLC). Not only that it's a completely separate installation so if you want to keep your skyrim modded like crazy with your old characters you can play with them without any kind of problem or conflict. And the saves are also separated you only have to copy/paste them to play with your characters on the special edition (at least if you deactivated your mods and saved before). So why would you complain ? And also this special edition is a great way for those who never played this title to start. And I still believe 40e for getting everything is really not a lot for what this game has to offer on the opposite of several other titles where the price never went down with the time the price of skyrim was always reduced to the point of having it at 15e without sales.Now about what they added well mainly they improved the performances. Comparison just came out and the special edition performs better them the old one on the same configuration without mods. Hence you can expect to be able to mod this version more heavily before having performance issues. And that's something I'm waiting for. They also improved the graphics in comparison to the base game and I have to say from the little bit I played it does look good. I was never fan of big ENBs and prefered using IMAGINATOR so it's what I like to play. However for those who like to play with ENBs one of Fallout 4 is already available on the nexus and we can expect a lot more in the coming days. And for those who nerver played this game or don't like using mods it's a really good improvement.In conclusion I do believe this special edition is a good thing. It will help us mod skyrim to a new level and also adds some pretty nice features in addition.PS for those who use laptops if you're encountering stutters you might want to check if you launched the game with your chipset and not with your graphic card and if that's the case force the card to be used.

6559,"2019-02-01",5,210,15,0,1,On paper an indie game made by a lesser known French studio where a lesser known faction of the 40k mythos is pitched against a lesser known enemy of the 40k mythos using a plethora of weird mechanics and opaque systems has all the hallmarks of that most well known of gaming phenomena the utter waste of a Games Workshop IP.It is of note therefore that the Tech Priests of Bulwark must have anointed their design work with blessed oils and the studio must have been thick with the righteous smoke of the holy cencer because as it turns out it's a quite remarkable little game and one of the best and most original uses of a GW IP I've seen in a long time.Firstly there's the quality of the writing. I honestly cannot remember the last time the 40k universe felt so visceral and real. There's a genuinely deft touch at work here which makes it feel like actual science fiction rather than genre fiction. From my 15 hours of play I know and care about the AdMech more than I've known or cared about a 40k faction since the 1980s. Also of note is how the writing and the awareness of the lore feeds directly into the game design choices the writing doesn't feel like a layer than sits atop the mechanics but rather a well executed design facet. It's really very clever and a joy to behold.And so to the meat of the thing how does Mechanicus play? Well the AdMech (short for Adeptus Mechanicus) are the faction of humanity who act as the scientists the engineers and the guardians of ancient lore all rolled into one. They make and maintain everything from Storm Bolters to Titans and they do so with a pseudo Catholic religious fervour. They also self augment machinery into their bodies which makes them as much Cyberpunks as Apostles. Anyhoo a Mechanicus spaceship rocks up to a dormant Necron world and triggers it's slow but inevitable awakening. Your commanding officer soon determines that your cohort will either stop the Necrons or die trying.Play consists of talking to one of your Tech Priests and taking a mission from them which you will lead down into the many tombs that riddle the alien world. Each Priest has their own agenda which in some cases is in direct opposition to another Priest. Scaevola talks in a datastream it's humanity and emotions almost non existant. Scaevola wants to acquire knowledge from the Necrons. Scaevola clearly admires them and expresses pleasure when new enemies are discovered. Videx speaks in aphorisms culled from the holy texts of the Omnissiah. Videx believes that the tombs should be scourged of all xenos influence. Videx constantly counsels that humanity courts corruption by examining the Necrons and quotes scripture to back up his stance. The banter between these two and their commanding officers attempts to mediate between them is really very entertaining! Who you choose to do missions for appears to have a direct effect on how things pan out.Mission picked you then choose the troops you wish to deploy. These consist of varying types of meat shield (which you diversify the roster of as the game opens up) and your precious Tech Priests. The mission itself is then a top down affair where you are shown a map detailing all the available rooms and corridors. From here you plan your path through the tomb. Most rooms offer a Choose Your Own Adventure style choice wherein various rewards and penalties will be levelled. Within each tomb there will also be at least one fight where the map dissolves into XCOM esque isometric turn based combat.Here's the weirdest and for me one of the loveliest parts of Mechanicus the turn based combat has very little RNG going on. It's more like a game of chess on a procedurally generated map where your meat shield troops are your pawns and your Tech Priests are your back row. A universal pool of points exists which you harvest and deploy as you see fit between your troops as the turn progresses. You can choose to burn the lot on one hero priest who goes on a solo killing spree or spread them evenly amongst your cohort as you proceed the choice is entirely yours. The nuances here are surprisingly subtle and as the system doesn't correspond to many (if any) other games I am finding the process of discovering what I am capable of to be very rewarding. A successful mission awards you new kit and a substance called blackstone which you spend on your Priests to open up the various skill trees. Sculpting a Priests build by working out what skills dovetail with what items is proving pleasingly complex.Of final note is probably my favourite aspect of the game the awakening of the Necron planet and the triggering of the final boss fight is hard capped. Each mission will advance the awakening a minimum of 3% but poor choices and bad luck can easily make it double that so you are permanently searching for the sweet spot on an invisible bell curve where you get the most experience and loot for your troops whilst minimising how much you awaken the planet in the process.It is commonly held that the challenge drops off as you get further into the campaign and I have to say that in spite of a recent patch that apparently addressed this issue this still appears to be true to a certain extent. However. I am still finding the originality of the ideas their excellent implementation and the overall quality of the product continues to outweigh any levelling out of the difficulty curve. To this end I would recommend figuring the game out from first principals and steering away from any guides that tell you much more than I've done here Mechanicus really is at it's best when you're trying to make sense of it.8/10 Would happily aspire to transcend this crude biomass again!,"Warhammer 40,000: Mechanicus",1,
6560,"2018-11-16",46,174,13,0,1,"Man AdMech. I'd wanted them to get a proper army since I was in middle school. Back in the day I would paint up metal Vostroyan figures in Mars colors and call them Skitarii. I got into Forge World's Horus Heresy just so I could play a Mechanicum army. When they finally got a proper 40k release I immediately dropped several hundred bucks on building a War Convocation which I later bolstered with a Warhound Titan for my group's Apocalypse games. I regret nothing. I love the Adeptus Mechanicus.I also love isometric tactical games and man this game is like a dream come true. Think Jagged Alliance 2 with cyborgs. If you don't think that sounds awesome you need the lameness and suckitude centers of your weak fleshy brain excised. Unfortunately ever since THQ went down (RIP) 40k games have had a pretty sharp drop off in quality so naturally I was a bit wary. I mean hell even the latest Dawn of War wasn't all that great. Worry not. This one is a solid entry.It is the year 40 000. Everything sucks. You play as Magos Dominus Faustinius of the Adeptus Mechanicus a group of fanatically religious Martian transhuman cyborgs who extoll the weaknesses of flesh and probably listen to way too much Mega Drive. You are waging a campaign against the Necrons billion year old super future Egyptian robot aliens that want to literally kill all organic life in the galaxy (and could probably pull it off too). They probably also listen to too much Mega Drive but most likely believe that 198XAD was a better album than Hardwired so that's reason enough for these two factions to go to war.Along the way you do the typical Squad Based Game song and dance. You wage a world map campaign manage the inventory and upgrades on your dudes listen to your advisors the works. Interestingly the game differs from XCOM in that it's more about the mission than your squad. Life is cheap in the 41st millenium and this game nails that feeling. Rather than cautiously inch forward with your veterans you are encouraged to throw cannon fodder ""troops"" at your enemies which will be replenished once the mission ends. And the missions themselves are damn solid affairs. The Cognition mechanic allows your Tech Priests (read heroes) to use more powerful equipment and increase their action economy by harvesting knowledge from objectives and slain enemies. This keeps the turn based combat feeling surprisingly fast paced and it's a refreshing departure from the XCOM gold standard of alternating activations and double actions.All in all damn solid game and worth a playthrough or two. I would highly recommend it if you're a 40k fan. Otherwise worth grabbing the next time you catch it on sale.","Warhammer 40,000: Mechanicus",1,

The aesthetics are truly wonderful and the sound design is unforgettable. It is well paced not over simplified yet not too caught up in tactical micromanagement. The basic gameplay loop is expansive and interesting.Bugs are very exceptional the controls are crisp and responsive.When you juice up your tech priests the game can get a bit easy but it is still fun. Actually it is so much fun that time flew by and I finished it in two long sessions. Still loved every second of it every weird and alien sound every new upgrade and every instance of shooting a damn necron back into wherever their ugly xenos face got spit out from.This game is a gem. It is evidently crafted with lots of love and care and lots of thought came into this unique and nightmarishly beautiful depiction of 40k. The basic conflict between necrons and the adeptus mechanicus is interesting as well and it makes you think about the similarities between them as well as about the whole relationship between mankind and machines.What is left to say?

6563,"2018-11-15",2,110,44,0,1,"Mechanicus is a game that shares a few similarities with XCOM. However has a lot of unique mechanics that make it very much its own game. Video Reviewhttps //www.youtube.com/watch?v PQWgBoWvSbk Written Review Set in the 40K universe you play as a squad of Tech Priests trying to keep Necrons at bay while exploring their crypts. As someone who has never delved into the 40K universe this has been the first time I have been so excited to experience it as the lore behind these guys is very interesting. The game's characters are all very unique and have distinct personalities. They disagree on a lot of things and these conflicts are well written as well as the descriptions of rooms which create a strong and vivid atmosphere. The music and sounds that accompanies all this really helps drive a tense and immersive world. As for the gameplay once you enter a crypt you are given the choice which rooms you want to enter and in doing so will be met with random encounters that you must deal with. For example you might find a wounded enemy. You might be able to finish it off capture it for research or just leave it be. Depending on what you choose you will get a different outcome. You might earn material rewards take damage alert the enemies to your presence etc. Different characters will comment or react differently depending on their interests which makes your choices that much more compelling As you progress through the crypt the ""awake"" meter will increase which means you do not want to linger too long and fully explore. As the meter rises enemies will be buffed making the mission a lot harder. Once you've completed the mission that ""awake"" meter will carry over onto a global ""awake"" meter similarly to the ""Avatar Project"" in Xcom 2. This forces you to be very careful about the choices you make and to try tread quickly which I really enjoy but I can see it being a negative for some people. Once you encounter enemies you will be placed into a battle mode. It is NOT like Xcom where you as the player control all units at once and then the enemy has their turn. Instead each unit has its own turn that you can see on the timeline. Each unit has a set number of tiles it can travel. As an example if your unit has the ability to walk 10 tiles away if you only walk one tile and then shoot you will then still be allowed to walk the rest of your 9 tiles if you choose to. Also you are allowed to use multiple actions at once including multiple guns melee healing etc provided you have the CP for it. CP stands for Cognition points which is a currency you use in battle. You can use this to walk further than your usual walking distance. It is also needed to attack with certain weapons. You gain CP by absorbing it from enemies and pillars throughout the battle. Once a whole battle round has ended (meaning everyone has played their turn) all pillars will refill their CP allowing you to gather more. Gameplay revolving CP can be really in depth because it's all about spending it correctly. You could in theory traverse the entire battlefield as long as you keep absorbing CP on your way there. You can also send your companion servo skulls over to distant pillars in order to absorb some CP for you. Cover is not used in the game like in Xcom. Yes you can break line of sight by standing behind a wall. but your characters do not actually take cover nor are there bonuses for full/half cover. Instead you send expendable units known as troops. One example of a troop is called ""Servitor'. Which is a throwaway unit that is meant to be cannon fodder to protect your more valuable Tech Priests. They can only melee don't have much health and can't walk far but will attract enemy fire and once hit will actually give you CP. Under the explanation that the Tech Priests are ""studying the enemy weaponry as they attack the Servitors"". It's a really interesting mechanic that also builds upon the lore. There are a few other mechanics during battle that make it interesting like resistances to certain weapon types or one time use spells as well as charging weaponry after usage but I don't want to oversaturate the review. I've explained the core mechanics. To summarise the combat feels very original to me and is quite enjoyable. Once you're done with a mission you will earn rewards. You then have the choice of what mission to undertake next as well as what units to take with you. In your ship between missions you can also customize your units. You have the choice to rename and colour them whatever you want which is a welcome option. You will then use any blackstone you've acquired in order to upgrade your units. You can choose perks from multiple trees that focus on different things. Upon doing that the next upgrade will cost more and you will earn an augmentation slot. With this slot you can now equip a new weapon/armor or whatever you desire to the unit. This allows you to have multiple weapons and gadgets which makes your character look like a badass.Overall I'm really loving the game. The soundtrack is so cool and really compliments the atmosphere created by the well written descriptions and characters. Gameplay is original and gratifying and upgrading your characters feels satisfying. I'm very happy to finally be introduced to the 40k universe through a side of it I find incredibly interesting. I highly recommend the game!","Warhammer 40,000: Mechanicus",1,
6564,"2018-11-17",1,37,10,0,1,YOUR FLESH WILL ROT AND DECAY.STEEL IS IMMORTAL.FOR THE OMNISSIAH.This is a really good somewhat xcom inspired Strategy game.The mission structure of the game is pretty neat you basically play the game against a countdown and once the countdown is over the necron pharaoh awakens.So what do you do to prevent the countdown from ticking down? Nothing!Because the goal isn't to finish the game before the countdown runs out (although this is possible as i achieved it on my first playthrough).The goal is to gain as many ressources and upgrades as you can while the countdown is running respectively to weaken the bossboss by taking out the other 5 bosses that will come to aid him if they're still alive.The combat is fairly basic as in if you've ever played a turn based strategy game you will feel right at home however it is pretty fun as the game contains a lot of different equipment enemy types and such although i'd have to lie if i were to say that there isn't some degree of repetition involved.The game takes some cues from the xcom formular as your core troop consists of 2 (upgradable to 6) Tech Priests each with 12 equipment slots and 6 little skillstrees.Unlike XCOM there is no permadeath involved as WE HAVE CASTED AWAY OUR WEAK VESSELS OF FLESH and instead dead priests will simply be repaired after a mission although at a fairly high cost.The game expands on this formular by additionally giving you access to different stormtroopers who are meant to be disposable and cost a little bit of ressources to use.All in all the core gameplay loop of EXTERMINATING THE XENOS HERESY is really fun and enjoyable the biggest issue this game has is that the game only has one difficulty and is designed around the idea that you occasionally will fail a mission however if you don't you eventually start snowballing really hard because your own troops become stronger at a much faster rate than your opponent.Nonetheeless i'd definitley recommend checking this one out.,"Warhammer 40,000: Mechanicus",1,
6565,"2018-11-17",3,41,38,0,1,"Domini and Dominae I believe what we are dealing with here is a jewel. That very rare and elusive beast of a game that comes every once in a blue moon cycle (Terran standard) to give an exceptional example of what a Warhammer 40k tale should be.It is incredibly loyal to the fluff not only by the binaric lines of the protagonists but by the very mechanics in the game that will make you catch yourself thinking like a Magos of the hallowed Mechanicum in exactly (t 32*y &lt 2300/# x (alpha.phi)) minutes into the game.A race against time both in the campaign segment and in every Mission and battle you will be driven ever onwards in your Quest for Knowledge to both uncover the relics of mankinds past and beat the clock ticking away the days to the full awakening of the Necrons.Standing on the shoulders of Giants the developers used 20+ years of fleshing out the Cult in the lore to bring you every possible facet a Magos may adopt represented in the cast that advise and guide you on your journey the Grounded no nonsense one the ambitions borderline Heretek one the Conservatic dogma spouting one and others (""lets just pray harder at it!"") who all speak via the lingua technis immersing me in the fantasy that I'm but a Techpriest on mission from Mars. Contrast that to the filthy awakening Xenos who are voiced in perfect English.Making the first boss encounter basically ""Beep boo boop beep?""""Pzzt baaa bee beep boo 1101 0101 1101 1000""""What the hell are you doing in my house? Get the hell outta here Imma kick your """"Beep boop!""Joy.It's turn based giving you plenty of time to ponder your next step into damnation team based so you *have* to coordinate both your highly customizable Tech priests and your Cohorts of sorry subDomina Disposable troops but unlike X Com it removes an element of chance where your 95% hit chance misses for the 3rd time in a row. Well damage still comes in ranges and unless you scan it you have no idea how much more the enemy can take or his armor. Foes have advanced reanimation protocols so that's cool that you've killed it but now you have to stomp it while it's down or else it's coming back!To give you an edge while losing you may be choosing one of the many Canticles of the Omnissiah a single use per mission buff that when played correctly gives you that needed armor shredding or extra movement to finish the mission this turn and avoid disaster in the next.I cannot reccomend this enough Mechanicus is a legend in the making and you should NOT be missing out.I'm definetly hooked.","Warhammer 40,000: Mechanicus",1,

This is one of the best Warhammer 40k games I have ever played and the unit management upgrades combat is fantastic.One thing to note the campaign is relatively short and I beat it in 17 hours unlocking 17/22 achievements in my first play through. The game is relatively easy if you are used to X Com style games even the hardest settings are easy and I was able to kill the final 3 bosses in just 3 rounds in the game with the final boss with 1 character in 1 round.

6567,"2018-11-18",1,44,12,0,1,As a disclaimer I'm an AdMech player on the tabletop so this review is going to be completely biased. A lot of games come out in the 40k universe and there are very few that are actually worth the price. By the grace of the Omnissiah 40k Mechanicus is one of those games that every 40k fan out there should support. Its not without its issues notably the game gets too easy once your tech priests are half way equiped and you can field proper Skitarii troops also the Necron AI at times is less than intelligent.There also doesn't seem to be any method of reducing the Awakeness gauge or an endless mode so once you beat the main game its pretty much over (I'd advise keeping a backup of your save just incase DLC or something gets added).All that being said Mechanicus is still a lot of fun. At its core its a rather simple but addictive turn based tactics game. I consider it sort of XCOM lite. Cover is pretty much just line of sight (which lets you cheese pretty bad) and the maps aren't very big but they get the job done. Once you start understanding what each troop unit can do what combos of tech priest upgrades and equipment work well together you'll be blasting through the Necron tombs with ease. Ultimately what sold me was the ability to play as the AdMech. I'm so used to the Space Marines taking center stage with everything that its so refreshing to see a 40k game that does not have an ultra smurf running around. Bottom line is that if you like tactics games (think XCOM) you like 40k and you want a game you can just sit down and enjoy Mechanicus is totally for you. If not still buy it cause I want more AdMech stuff and this is great advertisment.

It's fun has soul and spirit is not overcomplicated or frustrating.+ Great atmosphere (especially banter and disputes between characters who give missions and track the progress of your squad during missions)+ Solid tactical game with some good ideas+ Good customization options for your TechPriests+ The story is interesting enough the dialogues are fun+ Nice OST really helps to immerse Only one enemy faction (Necrons). But it's the matter of Games Workshop licence and not really developer's fault. Besides Necrons are the most fitting xenos enemy for AdMech lorewise. Once you level up and customize your TechPriests well enough the game becomes much easier. It's still fun for me but might not please those who want more challenge.
